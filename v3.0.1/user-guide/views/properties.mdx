#### Locking and Unlocking
Click the Lock Icon to prevent editing of this Object. When locked, neither Users nor Davinci will be able to edit the Object. Click the Lock Icon again to enable editing.
<Note>Locking an Object will also Lock all Child Objects at the same time.</Note>

#### Object Type Icon
Next to the Lock Icon is the Object Type Icon. Every Object has a Type, and the current Object Type will be displayed here as an Icon.

#### Naming an Object
To the left of the Object Type Icon is the Name Field. Click on the Name Field to edit the Name of the Object. Click out of the field or press Enter to save the name.

**Shortname (Optional)**

Next to the Name Field inside the parentheses is the Object Shortname Field. The Shortname is used in some elements like Equations and Rollups.

### Documentation
Beneath the Name Header is the Documentation Field. This field allows you to describe the Object in plain text. When Davinci creates an Object, it will fill in the Documentation with a description of what the Object is, and its relationship to the rest of the Model. It may also describe why this Object is important.

Only Reference Objects can be added as References.

### Relationships

<Note>Both `uses` and `reference` relationships can not be added or removed here. To update those relationships the associated reference field or value field must be updated.</Note>
