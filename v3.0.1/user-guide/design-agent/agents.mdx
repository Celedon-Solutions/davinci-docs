## Description  
Davinci is a fully automated engineering platform that leverages agentic AI to execute complex modeling tasks. You interact with Davinci by sending instructions through the chat interface at the bottom of the screen.  


## Starting an Agent
To use the design agents you start by prompting an objective in the main chat interface at the bottom of the screen and submit.

Depending on the what is requested, Davinci will either start up a design agent or, for simple questions, respond directly in the chat interface.


<Note>You can initiate multiple design agents simultaneously.</Note>  

## Viewing Agent Details
On the top bar of the chat area any agents started, actively running, or completed are displayed. Active agents will have a blue background with an animation. Completed agents will be grayed out.

To view the details of an agent click on the `View Agent` button in the chat message. This will open a new tab displaying the agent details where you can monitor status, progress, or interact with the agent will it peforms tasks.

In this example, the first chat bubble is the user prompt on the top right. As the agent works it will provide feedback, model updates, and call different tools to complete the task. Tools will show up as dark bubbles with their results, along with model updates, in blue. Clicking on these result bubbles will show their details on the right side. 

## Stopping, Starting, and Chatting with Agents
At any time you can stop the agent by clicking the stop icon in the bottom-right corner in the agent chat bar. 

In addition, you can also provide chat instructions to the agent which will be added to the agent's context during its next steps.

When all tasks are completed, the agent will return a task complete bubble in green. Clicking on this will provide a change log in the right side panel.  

<Note>
Agents are still an early feature and should be monitored to ensure they stay on track.

## Change Log  
For every completed task or model update call, you can review the changes Davinci made to the model. These changes are shown as a table organized by rows for each object and columns for the properties of the object that were changed. Additions are shown in green, removals/old values in red. Moved objects are shown with a dashed border in the old position and green in the new position. Changes to the documentation or name are shown by a green border.

## Undoing Changes
At any time you can revert back to checkpoints at the chat messages in the agent history. Doing so will undo all changes made since that checkpoint.
