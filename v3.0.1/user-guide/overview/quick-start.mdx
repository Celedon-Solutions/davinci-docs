This guide will teach you how to get up and running with Davinci in minutes.

## 1. Log In or Create an Account
[Follow this link to access Davinci](https://davinci-app.com/app). Enter your email address in the box. 
- If you already have an account, enter your password and log in. 
- If you do **not** already have an account, you will be prompted to enter your name and create a password. From there you will pick which plan you want and check out. After checking out, you will be redirected to Davinci. Follow the link above again if you are not automatically redirected.

## 2. Create a New Project
From the home page click the `New Project` button.

</Frame>

 This will create a new Project inside your Owned Project list and prompt you to name the Project. Enter a Project name and press Enter to continue.
 
 <Frame>
    <img height="400" src="/images/home_project_def.jpg" /> 
</Frame>

 Once named, the project will get asssigned a Project ID. Once that ID is ready, click on the Project in the list to load it.



## 3. Execute your First Task
Once you are in the Project, you can begin creating your Model. Go to the Chat Bar at the bottom and try asking Davinci to build a simple parts tree. Press Enter to send messages to Davinci.

</Frame>

## 4. Review the Results
Once the task is compelete, you will see new objects populated in the Model Index. You can either interact directly with the objects by clicking on them in the index. If you want to focus specifically on what Davinci created during that task, you can click on the `View` button in the Chat response to see a change log of the modifications.
