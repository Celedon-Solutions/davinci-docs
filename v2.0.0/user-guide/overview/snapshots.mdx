title: Snapshots

## Description
Projects can be saved into snapshots, which capture the state of the model at the time of the snapshot. Any snapshot can be saved but pushing that live will override and replace the current active data for the project for all users. 

To push any snapshot to the active mode, just select one from the lists and click the `Push To Active` button.

<Warning>Pushing snapshots will update the model for all users.</Warning>

## User Snapshots
Users can make a snapshot at any time by clicking the  `Add Snapshot` button. The `name` field is required but the `description` field is optional. 


## Automatic Snapshots
Davinci will automatically make snapshots for projects at a reguarly interval. These are like regular snapshots but automatically captured.
