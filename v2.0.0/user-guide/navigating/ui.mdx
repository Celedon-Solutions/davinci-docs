title: Navigating Work Areas
---

Basic Navigation in Davinci uses the Navigation Bar to move between Work Areas.

## Navigation Bar
The `Navigation Bar` appears on the far left of the window and has three primary Work Areas:

1. `Model`: Create, view, and edit the Model from here.
2. `Project`: Manage elements of the Project such as Collaborators, Files, and Model Completeness.
3. `Home`: Click here to return to the Home Page.




## Home
Home is the first Area viewed when loading into Davinci. Here you can select or create projects.

<Note>Before selecting a project, only the Home Area is visible in the Navigation Bar.</Note>

## Model
The Model Area appears when a Project is loaded from the Home Area.

## Project 
The Project Area is accessed from the Navigation Pane on the far left of the window. Like Model, this is only active when a project has been selected. In this view you can see the project summary, see collaborators, review snapshots, update custom units, or remove files stored in your project. 

### Rename a Project
Projects are renamed from the Project Summary Tab in the Project Area. Click on the name of your Project at the top of the Area and begin typing to rename.

## Search
At the top of the window is a search box, clicking on this will open up a search menu. Clicking on search results will open them up in the main tab. 

<Note>The Search Bar is only enabled when a Project is loaded.</Note>

## Account Management
Your User Account can be managed at any time by clicking on your initial in the top right of the screen. This will open the `Account Manager`, where you can access information about your subscription, reset your password, or refill your Credits.
