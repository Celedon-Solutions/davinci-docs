## Description  
Davinci is a fully automated engineering platform that leverages agentic AI to execute complex modeling tasks. You interact with Davinci by sending instructions through the chat interface at the bottom of the screen.  

Davinci can perform multiple tasks in response to a user request. An example is shown below:

In this example, Davinci identifies two tasks to complete. For each task, it outlines the objectives, which are executed sequentially. The active task is highlighted with a blue number bubble. Once completed, the bubble turns green, while pending tasks remain white.  

Each completed task has a change log, accessible via the `View` button. At any time, you can stop the process by clicking the stop icon in the top-left corner of the task.  

When all tasks are completed, Davinci provides a concise summary at the bottom of the objectives list.  

<Note>You can initiate multiple design requests simultaneously.</Note>  

## Change Log  
For every completed task, you can review the changes Davinci made to the model. These changes are categorized into `Additions`, `Removals`, and `Updates`. You can revert all modifications using the `Undo All` button on the right. For updates, individual changes can be undone or redone separately.
