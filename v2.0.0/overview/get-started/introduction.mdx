## What is Davinci?  

Davinci is an automated digital engineering tool that transforms natural language inputs into complete models. It serves as your AI design assistant, integrating knowledge storage, data visualization, coding, and documentation into a seamless, end-to-end platform.  

## How Does It Work?  

Davinci is a web application that connects users to a powerful AI service for automated engineering. It interfaces with both the AI service and a project database, enabling a smooth and intelligent design workflow.  

<Note>**Enterprise Features:** Advanced and custom deployment options are available for enterprise users.  </Note>

## Key Features  

Davinci provides a comprehensive suite of tools for object modeling, system design, and seamless integration with code and document creation. With Davinci, you can:  

- **Model Requirements** – Define systems with mathematical constraints.  
- **Build Parts Trees** – Create hierarchical structures with interconnected attributes.  
- **Organize Models & Data** – Structure your project into folders for easy management.  
- **Upload Reference Documentation** – Attach PDFs, text files, and other data to your models.  
- **Digitize Reference Information** – Extract insights using multimodal AI.  
- **Natural Language Q&A** – Interact with your models through conversational AI.  
- **Table Artifacts** – Structure and manage tabular data effectively.  
- **AI-Powered Word Processing** – Create, edit, and refine documents with AI assistance.  

## New Features  

We are continuously expanding Davinci’s capabilities with advanced features, including some early testing deployment of:  

- **Action Sequence Modeling** – Define and analyze system behaviors step-by-step.  
- **Python Support in the Browser** – Write, execute, and edit Python code with AI-assisted development.  
- **3D Assembly Modeling** – Visualize and manipulate 3D bounding box components directly within Davinci.  

Davinci supports the core **digital engineering workflow** with its **SysML v2-based object schema**, seamlessly integrating modeling, coding, and documentation.
