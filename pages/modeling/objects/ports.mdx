## Description
Ports specify interaction points on system components that define how parts interface with their environment and with each other. In SysML v2, ports are essential modeling elements that facilitate communication and interaction between system components, defining the interfaces through which information, energy, or material flows.

Ports encapsulate the interaction details of a component, hiding internal implementation while exposing only the necessary interface points. They specify what flows in and out of a component, what protocols are used, and what properties characterize the interactions. This enables modular system design where components can be developed independently as long as they satisfy their port specifications, ensuring proper integration and interoperability.

<Note>Ports should be defined at the lowest level of logical decomposition where the interface is actually implemented. They represent the physical or logical connection points where components interact with the system or with each other.</Note>
