## Description
Items represent individual elements or units that flow through a system, such as data packets, physical materials, energy, or information. In SysML v2, items are specialized objects used to model things that are created, transformed, consumed, or transferred between system components during operations.

Items are particularly useful for modeling the inputs and outputs of actions, the contents of flows between ports, and the resources that move through a system. Unlike parts which have persistent existence in the system structure, items typically represent transient entities that are processed, transmitted, or transformed as the system operates. Items can have attributes that define their properties (such as size, priority, or content) and can be composed of other items to represent complex data structures or material assemblies.

<Note>Items are commonly used in flow-based modeling to specify what is being transferred between system components through ports and interfaces.</Note>
