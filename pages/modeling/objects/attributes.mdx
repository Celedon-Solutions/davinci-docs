## Description
Attributes define properties or characteristics of system elements, specifying quantitative or qualitative aspects such as dimensions, weight, material properties, performance metrics, or other parameters. In SysML v2, attributes are fundamental modeling elements that capture the values and properties that describe system components.

Attributes can contain singular values (strings, numbers, or booleans), or they can reference other attributes in the model, creating calculated relationships between system properties. They support units of measurement and type specifications, enabling precise engineering analysis and ensuring consistency across the model. When attributes reference other values, they can perform unit conversions automatically, allowing engineers to view the same property in different unit systems.

<Note>The unit field is optional but recommended for engineering values. When specified, it enables automatic unit conversion and helps prevent errors in calculations. For attributes that reference other attributes, the unit can be changed and the evaluated value will be transformed automatically if the conversion is possible.</Note>
