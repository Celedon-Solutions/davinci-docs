## Description
Linkages represent mechanical connections and kinematic relationships between physical components in a system. In SysML v2, linkages are parts, in Davinci they are parts used for specialized structural elements to model joints, cables, couplings, and other physical connections that constrain the relative motion or provides flow of an interface between parts.

<Note>Linkages are particularly important for modeling cables, working with ports and interfaces to define the physical thing which flows the interfaces.</Note>
