## Description
Parts represent components or subsystems within a larger system, forming the fundamental building blocks of system structure in Model-Based Systems Engineering. In SysML v2, parts are objects that illustrate the hierarchical composition of systems, showing how components are assembled to form the whole system.

Parts are the main structural elements that can represent any kind of physical or logical component with an extent in both time and space. They encapsulate both structural and behavioral features, making them modular units that define how a system is organized and how its components interact. Parts have values and parameters defined by their owned Attributes, and they can contain other parts, creating nested hierarchies that represent complex system architectures.

<Note>A special object type called [Entity](/pages/modeling/objects/entities) exists to model persons, groups, environments, and organizations, which are not parts of a system.</Note>

## View Types
