## Description
Risk objects represent potential uncertain events or conditions that, if they occur, have a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. In systems engineering, risks are typically characterized by their probability of occurrence and the impact they would have. Managing risks involves identifying, analyzing, and planning responses to these uncertainties to minimize negative outcomes and maximize opportunities.
