## Description
Linkages represent mechanical connections and kinematic relationships between physical components in a system. In SysML v2, linkages are parts, in Davinci they are parts used for specialized structural elements to model joints, cables, couplings, and other physical connections that constrain the relative motion or provides flow of an interface between parts.

<Note>Linkages are particularly important for modeling cables, working with ports and interfaces to define the physical thing which flows the interfaces.</Note>

## Common Linkage Types

### Electrical Cables and Wiring
Electrical cables provide power and signal transmission between components.

**Key Attributes:**
- Cable length and routing path
- Wire gauge (AWG) and conductor count
- Voltage and current ratings
- Insulation type and temperature rating
- Shielding specifications
- Connector types at each end

**Use Cases:**
- Power distribution cables
- Signal and data cables
- Sensor wiring harnesses
- Control system interconnects
- Communication buses

**Example:**
A power cable connecting a battery to a motor controller would have attributes for voltage rating (48V), current capacity (100A), cable length (2m), and connector types (Anderson PowerPole at both ends).

### Fluid and Pneumatic Lines
Tubes, hoses, and pipes that transport fluids, gases, or hydraulic power.

**Key Attributes:**
- Line diameter and wall thickness
- Material type (rubber, metal, composite)
- Pressure rating and temperature range
- Bend radius limits
- Fitting and connector types

**Use Cases:**
- Hydraulic lines
- Pneumatic tubing

**Example:**
A hydraulic line in a robotic arm would specify pressure rating (3000 PSI), line diameter (0.5 inch), material (steel braided hose), and minimum bend radius (4 inches).

### Mechanical Cables
Flexible mechanical cables that transmit force or motion.

**Key Attributes:**

## Cable Routing and Management

Cables and flexible connections require careful routing and management:

### Routing Constraints
Physical constraints affect cable paths:
- **Minimum bend radius**: Prevents damage to cables and maintains performance
- **Cable length**: Total length including service loops and strain relief
- **Routing path**: Physical path through the system structure
- **Clearances**: Separation from moving parts, heat sources, and sharp edges
- **Support points**: Clamps, ties, and guides along the route

### Electrical Considerations
For electrical cables, consider:
- **Voltage drop**: Resistance over cable length affects delivered voltage
- **Current capacity**: Wire gauge must support maximum current
- **Signal integrity**: Shielding and separation for sensitive signals
- **EMI/EMC**: Electromagnetic interference and compatibility
- **Grounding**: Proper grounding and shielding connections

### Thermal Management
Temperature affects cable performance:
- **Ambient temperature**: Operating environment temperature range
- **Current heating**: I²R losses generate heat in conductors
- **Insulation rating**: Maximum temperature for insulation materials
- **Derating**: Reduced capacity in high-temperature environments

## Mechanical Joint Analysis

For mechanical linkages, kinematic and dynamic analysis is essential:

### Degrees of Freedom
Calculate mechanism mobility:
- **Revolute joints**: 1 DOF (rotation about axis)
- **Prismatic joints**: 1 DOF (translation along axis)
- **Spherical joints**: 3 DOF (rotation about three axes)
- **Cylindrical joints**: 2 DOF (rotation and translation)

### Force and Motion Transmission
Mechanical linkages transmit forces and motion:
- **Joint reaction forces**: Forces at connection points
- **Mechanical advantage**: Force/torque amplification or reduction
- **Friction losses**: Energy dissipation in joints
- **Backlash and compliance**: Play and flexibility in connections

### Load Analysis
Evaluate structural requirements:
- **Static loads**: Weight and steady-state forces
- **Dynamic loads**: Acceleration and impact forces
- **Fatigue**: Cyclic loading and lifetime considerations
- **Safety factors**: Design margins for reliability

## Best Practices

### Linkage Modeling

- **Clear Type Definition**: Specify the linkage type (cable, joint, line) clearly in documentation
- **Appropriate Attributes**: Include relevant parameters for the specific linkage type
- **Consistent Units**: Use consistent unit systems for all parameters
- **Realistic Specifications**: Define limits and ratings based on physical constraints and standards

### Cable and Connection Design

- **Proper Sizing**: Select wire gauge, hose diameter, or joint capacity based on requirements
- **Routing Planning**: Plan cable routes considering bend radius, clearances, and accessibility
- **Connector Selection**: Choose appropriate connectors for the application and environment
- **Service Loops**: Include extra length for maintenance and strain relief
- **Labeling**: Document cable identification and connection points
- **Testing**: Verify continuity, insulation, and performance after installation

### Mechanical Joint Design

- **Load Analysis**: Calculate forces and torques throughout the motion range
- **Workspace Analysis**: Verify mechanisms can reach required positions
- **Singularity Avoidance**: Identify and avoid kinematic singularities
- **Lubrication**: Plan for joint maintenance and lubrication
- **Wear Considerations**: Account for friction, wear, and lifetime

### Integration with System Model

- **Port Connections**: Use ports to define connection endpoints on parts
- **Interface Definition**: Use interfaces to specify what flows through the linkage
- **Item Specification**: Define items that represent the transmitted signals, power, or materials
- **Constraint Specification**: Use constraints to define performance limits and requirements
- **Coordinate Systems**: Establish consistent reference frames for spatial relationships

### Documentation and Validation

- **Bill of Materials**: Include linkage specifications in BOM with part numbers
- **Routing Diagrams**: Create cable routing and connection diagrams
- **Test Procedures**: Define acceptance tests for cables and connections
- **Failure Modes**: Consider failure modes, redundancy, and safety factors
