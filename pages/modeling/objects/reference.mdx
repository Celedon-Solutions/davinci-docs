## Description
Reference objects allow users to upload data directly into their Davinci system model. This is useful for keeping all data sources in one location, and for access by the agent. 

When the agent uses reference objects to generate or modify other model objects, it will create reference relationships between the reference object. This relationship will describe where in the reference object it found the information that it used.

Files can be uploaded and added as Reference Objects to the model by dragging and dropping the file into Davinci when a project is open, or by uploading with the upload button in the Library Index header.

The files that Reference objects contain can be managed inside [Project Settings](../../user-guide/overview/files).

## Importing Files

Reference objects support importing various file types, making it easy to integrate existing documentation, data, and media into your Davinci model.

### Supported File Types

**Documents:**
- PDF files - Technical specifications, datasheets, research papers
- Word documents (DOCX) - Requirements documents, design descriptions
- Excel spreadsheets (XLSX) - Data tables, BOMs, test results

**Images:**
- PNG, JPG, JPEG - Photographs, screenshots, diagrams
- GIF - Animated graphics, simple diagrams
- WebP - Modern compressed images

**Arbitrary Files:**
- Any file type can be uploaded for storage and agent access
- Non-standard formats stored as-is for reference

### Import Methods

**Drag and Drop:**
1. Open a project in Davinci
2. Drag files from your file system into the Davinci window
3. Files are automatically uploaded and Reference objects are created
4. Multiple files can be dragged simultaneously

**Upload Button:**
1. Click the upload button in the Library Index header
2. Select files from the file browser dialog
3. Files are uploaded and Reference objects are created

Both methods create Reference objects with appropriate metadata extracted from the file (filename, type, size).

### Document Conversion and Agent Usage

**Automatic Content Extraction:**
The Davinci agent can read and analyze imported files to extract information:
- PDF text extraction for datasheets and specifications
- Image analysis for diagrams and photographs
- Excel data parsing for tables and datasets
- Word document text extraction for requirements

**Agent-Assisted Model Population:**
When you ask the agent to extract information from a Reference object, it:
1. Reads the file content
2. Analyzes and structures the information
3. Creates appropriate model objects (requirements, attributes, parts, etc.)
4. Establishes reference relationships linking new objects back to the source

**Example:** Upload a component datasheet PDF, then ask the agent to "extract the specifications from @DatasheetReference and create attributes." The agent creates attribute objects with values from the datasheet and links them to the Reference object.

### Image Integration

Images imported as Reference objects can be:
- Inserted into Documents as figures or inline images
- Added to Slides for presentations
- Referenced in model object documentation
- Analyzed by the agent for diagram interpretation

Images are stored efficiently and can be reused throughout the model without duplication.
