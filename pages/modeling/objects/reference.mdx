## Description
Reference objects allow users to upload data directly into their Davinci system model. This is useful for keeping all data sources in one location, and for access by the agent. 

When the agent uses reference objects to generate or modify other model objects, it will create reference relationships between the reference object. This relationship will describe where in the reference object it found the information that it used.

Files can be uploaded and added as Reference Objects to the model by dragging and dropping the file into Davinci when a project is open, or by uploading with the upload button in the Library Index header.

The files that Reference objects contain can be managed inside [Project Settings](../../user-guide/overview/files).
