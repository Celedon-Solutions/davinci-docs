## Description
Constraints define conditions, restrictions, or relationships among model elements that must be maintained to ensure system compliance with requirements and design criteria. In SysML v2, constraints are mathematical or logical expressions that specify rules the system must adhere to, such as performance thresholds, safety limits, physical laws, or design boundaries.

Constraints are evaluable statements that return true or false, enabling automated verification of system properties. They can represent equations, inequalities, or logical conditions that govern system behavior and ensure that design decisions satisfy specified criteria. Constraints are commonly used within requirements to define the specific testable conditions for requirement verification, and within parametric analyses to express relationships between system properties for performance evaluation.
