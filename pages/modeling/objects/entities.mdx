## Description
Entities are specialized system components used to model human actors, organizations, groups, and other stakeholder elements that interact with or are part of the system. In SysML v2, entities represent the people, teams, and organizational units that play roles in system operations, development, or management.

While traditional parts represent physical or logical system components, entities capture the human and organizational aspects of systems engineering. They can model system operators, maintenance personnel, user groups, development teams, or external organizations that interact with the system. Entities can own attributes to define their characteristics (such as skills, responsibilities, or organizational structure) and can be linked to actions they perform, requirements they impose, or other system elements they interact with. This enables comprehensive modeling of socio-technical systems where human factors are critical to system success.
