## Description
Requirements specify conditions or capabilities that a system must satisfy to meet stakeholder needs and objectives. In SysML v2, requirements are fundamental elements that capture what the system must do, how well it must perform, and under what conditions it must operate. They form the foundation of system verification and validation activities.

Requirements in Davinci are formally captured through logical, evaluable statements that can be assessed as true or false. This enables automated verification of whether the system design meets its specified requirements. Each requirement can be decomposed into sub-requirements, creating a hierarchical structure that traces from high-level stakeholder needs down to detailed design specifications. Requirements are validated through their owned constraint objects, which define the specific testable conditions that determine requirement satisfaction.

<Info>While requirement descriptions are typically written as "shall" statements following systems engineering best practices, the actual evaluation and verification is performed using the mathematical constraints and conditions owned by the requirement.</Info>

Requirements can have the following status:

| Status | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `TRUE`     | All owned constraints or subrequirement(s) are `TRUE`|
| `FALSE`      | One or all of the owned constraints or subrequirement(s) are `FALSE` |
| `INCOMPLETE`   | Unable to evaluate to either true or false |

<Note>Object is incomplete if no constraint or subrequirement(s) exist or all subrequirement(s) are also incomplete.</Note>

## View Types

| View | Description |
