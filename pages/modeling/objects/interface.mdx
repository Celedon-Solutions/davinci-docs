## Description
Interfaces define the connections and relationships between ports, specifying how system components interact and communicate with each other. In SysML v2, interfaces represent the contracts for interactions between components, defining sets of operations, signals, and flows that components provide or require for proper system integration.

Interfaces model the communication paths between parts by linking their ports together, indicating that components are connected and can exchange information, energy, or materials. Multiple ports can be connected through a single interface, creating complex interaction networks that represent how the system's internal architecture enables its functionality. Interfaces ensure compatibility and interoperability between components by defining what each component expects from the others and what it provides in return.

## Properties Fields


<ParamField path="Name" type="string">
Name of the object.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Short Name" type="string">
Short name of the object.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Documentation" type="string">
  Description of the object.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Connect" type="array">
  Array of port UUIDs that are connected by this interface.

  This field lists all the ports that participate in this interface connection. Ports from different parts can be connected through a single interface, establishing communication paths between components.

  **Example:**
  An interface connecting a sensor to a processor would list both the sensor's output port and the processor's input port.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Topology" type="array">
  Array of connection topology definitions specifying how ports are interconnected.

  The topology field defines the specific connection patterns between ports in the interface. Each topology entry is an array of port UUIDs that form a connection group.

  **Structure:**
  ```
  [
    [port1_uuid, port2_uuid],      // Connection 1
    [port3_uuid, port4_uuid],      // Connection 2
    [port5_uuid, port6_uuid, ...]  // Connection N
  ]
  ```

  **Topology Patterns:**
  - **Point-to-Point**: `[[portA, portB]]` - Direct connection between two ports
  - **Bus**: `[[port1, port2, port3, ...]]` - Multiple ports on shared bus
  - **Star**: Multiple point-to-point connections from a central hub
  - **Mesh**: Multiple interconnected groups for redundancy

  **Use Cases:**
  - **Electrical networks**: Define which pins connect to which signals
  - **Data buses**: Specify bus topology and connected devices
  - **Hydraulic systems**: Map fluid paths between components
  - **Communication networks**: Define message routing topology

  <Note>The topology field provides fine-grained control over how ports are interconnected, enabling complex connection patterns beyond simple point-to-point links.</Note>

<ParamField path="Items" type="object">

<a href="/pages/modeling/objects/item" style={{ borderBottom: 'none' }}> <img height="20" noZoom src="/images/objecticons/item.svg" /> </a>

  A list of all Item objects that flow through this interface.

  Items define what is being transferred between connected ports, such as electrical signals, data packets, power, fluids, or materials.

  **Examples:**
  - Electrical interface: Voltage, Current, Ground items
  - Data interface: Message, Command, Status items
  - Hydraulic interface: Hydraulic Fluid, Pressure items

<a href="/pages/modeling/objects/attributes" style={{ borderBottom: 'none' }}> <img height="20" noZoom src="/images/objecticons/attribute.svg" /> </a>

  A list of all Attribute objects owned by this interface.

  Attributes can define interface characteristics such as bandwidth, voltage levels, impedance, flow rates, or other performance parameters.

  Attribute Equations, Units and Type can be edited here, as well as recalculated and deleted entirely.

## Interface Modeling Patterns

Interfaces define how components interact by connecting their ports and specifying what flows between them.

### Basic Point-to-Point Connection

The simplest interface connects two ports directly:

**Example: Sensor to Controller**
- **Connect**: `[sensor_output_port, controller_input_port]`
- **Topology**: `[[sensor_output_port, controller_input_port]]`
- **Items**: Temperature_Data, Timestamp

This creates a direct data path from the sensor to the controller, with specific items (temperature data and timestamp) flowing through the connection.

### Multi-Port Bus Connection

A bus interface connects multiple ports to a shared communication medium:

**Example: CAN Bus**
- **Connect**: `[ecu1_can_port, ecu2_can_port, ecu3_can_port, sensor_can_port]`
- **Topology**: `[[ecu1_can_port, ecu2_can_port, ecu3_can_port, sensor_can_port]]`
- **Items**: CAN_Message, CAN_High, CAN_Low, Ground
- **Attributes**: Baud_Rate (500 kbps), Bus_Length (10 m)

All ports share the same bus, enabling any device to communicate with any other device.

### Star Topology

A star configuration has a central hub with multiple point-to-point connections:

**Example: Ethernet Switch**
- **Connect**: `[switch_port1, device1_port, switch_port2, device2_port, switch_port3, device3_port]`
- **Topology**: 
  ```
  [
    [switch_port1, device1_port],
    [switch_port2, device2_port],
    [switch_port3, device3_port]
  ]
  ```
- **Items**: Ethernet_Frame, Power_over_Ethernet

Each device has a dedicated connection to the switch, which routes traffic between devices.

### Power Distribution

Power interfaces can have complex topologies:

**Example: Power Distribution Network**
- **Connect**: `[battery_pos, battery_neg, load1_pos, load1_neg, load2_pos, load2_neg]`
- **Topology**: 
  ```
  [
    [battery_pos, load1_pos, load2_pos],  // Positive rail
    [battery_neg, load1_neg, load2_neg]   // Ground/negative rail
  ]
  ```
- **Items**: Electrical_Power, Voltage, Current
- **Attributes**: Voltage_Level (48 V), Max_Current (100 A)

The topology defines separate positive and ground rails, with multiple loads connected in parallel.

## Working with Linkages

Interfaces are often realized through physical linkages (cables, wires, hoses, etc.). The relationship between interfaces and linkages:

- **Interface**: Defines the logical connection and what flows between ports
- **Linkage**: Represents the physical cable, wire, or conduit that implements the interface

**Example: USB Connection**
- **Interface**: USB_Interface
  - Connect: `[computer_usb_port, device_usb_port]`
  - Items: USB_Data_Plus, USB_Data_Minus, VBUS, Ground
  - Attributes: USB_Version (3.0), Data_Rate (5 Gbps)
- **Linkage**: USB_Cable
  - Ports: Connector_A (computer end), Connector_B (device end)
  - Interfaces: USB_Interface (references the interface above)
  - Attributes: Cable_Length (2 m), Shielding (Yes)

The interface defines what is being connected and what flows, while the linkage represents the physical implementation.

## Best Practices

### Interface Definition

- **Clear Purpose**: Document what the interface is for and what it connects
- **Complete Item List**: Specify all items that flow through the interface
- **Topology Specification**: Use topology field to define connection patterns explicitly
- **Attribute Documentation**: Include relevant performance characteristics

### Port Management

- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent names for ports
- **Type Matching**: Ensure connected ports are compatible
- **Direction Specification**: Clearly define input/output directions on ports
- **Multiplicity**: Document how many connections each port can support

### System Integration

- **Hierarchical Interfaces**: Use nested interfaces for complex systems
- **Interface Reuse**: Define standard interfaces that can be reused across the model
- **Physical Realization**: Link interfaces to linkages that implement them
- **Validation**: Verify that all ports in Connect array are included in Topology

### Documentation

- **Connection Diagrams**: Create visual representations of interface topology
- **Signal Lists**: Document all items flowing through the interface
- **Performance Specs**: Include bandwidth, latency, capacity attributes
- **Standards Compliance**: Reference applicable standards (USB, CAN, Ethernet, etc.)
