title: Relationships
---

## Description
Objects in the model have defined relationships with each other that establish an explicit knowledge graph of the system being modeled. These relationships are either unidirectional (`in` and `out`) or bidirectional (`inout`) and can be traversed by the user while exploring the model. A summary of the existing relationships in Davinci are dicussed below: 

<Note>Relationships must be given a Relationship Type when created. Select the Relationship Type, then the Relationship Object when creating a new Relationship</Note>

### Base Relationships
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Uses`  | Indicates that one element makes use of another within the model. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Reference`   | Denotes that a reference points to another element in the model. Is `out` from the reference object and `in` to its target. |
| `Performs`     | Represents that a part or entity is responsible for performing a specific action. Is `out` from the part and `in` to the action. |
| `Connect`   | Defines a connection between interfaces or ports. Is `inout`.|
| `Realized`      | Indicates that the object realizes some intent, design, or function of another object. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Subject`      | Defines the subject of a requirement, linking it to relevant parts, actions, or entities. Is `out` from the requirement and `in` to the target object. |
| `Mitigation` | Indicates that one element mitigates a risk, issue, or other problem related to another element. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Source` | Indicates the source or origin of the object or its intent. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Impact` | Represents the impact that one element has on another. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Dependency` | Indicates that one element depends on another. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Resource` | Indicates that one element uses a resource. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Validation` | Indicates that the element is validated by another element. Is `out` from the constraint and `in` to the target. |
| `Transition` | Indicates a transition between states. Is `out` from one state and `in` to another state. |
| `Result` | Indicates a result of one object occurring as a consequence of another object. Can be `in` and `out`. |



### Standard Custom Relationships
New projects always start with set of base custom relationships. You can choose to remove these from the [project settings view](/user-guide/project-settings/relationship-settings). 

<Note>All of the following are defined as `inout`.</Note>

| Property        | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Data`            | Represents the exchange of data between parts.     |
| `Power`           | Indicates a power connection between parts. |
| `Mechanical`      | Denotes a mechanical connection between parts.   |
| `Optical`        | Represents an optical link between parts.  |
| `Chemical`        | Describes a chemical interaction between parts.          |
| `Electromagnetic` | Represents an electromagnetic relationship between parts. |
| `Thermal`         | Indicates a thermal exchange between parts. |
| `Fluid`           | Indicates a fluid connection between parts. |
