Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and group objects across your project, regardless of their location in the model hierarchy. They can be used to mark objects by ownership, status, priority, requirements compliance, or any other classification relevant to your workflow.

## Using Tags

### Adding Tags to Objects

Tags can be applied directly from the [Properties View](/pages/user-guide/views/properties) of any object.

1. Click the **#** button located under the object name header
2. Type the name of the tag you want to apply
3. Select an existing tag from the list, or select `+ [Name]` to create a new tag on the fly

### Removing Tags from Objects

To remove a tag from an object:
1. Hover over the tag in the Properties View
2. Click the **X** icon that appears on the tag

## Managing Tags

Project-wide tag management is handled in [Project Settings](/pages/user-guide/navigating/project). Here you can view all tags, manage their assignments, and configure their properties.
