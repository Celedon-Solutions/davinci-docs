## Workspaces

Agents are tied to their workspaces, which can be managed from the bottom row of the Davinci window.

### Creating Workspaces

To start a new agent:
1. Create a new workspace using the `+` button in the workspace bar
2. Open the Agent view in the Right Panel
3. Begin sending instructions to your new agent

### Managing Workspaces

From the workspace bar you can:
- `Delete` workspaces when they're no longer needed
- `Duplicate` workspaces to create a copy with the same chat history
- `Rename` workspaces to keep track of different agents and their purposes

### Workspace States

Workspaces can have 3 main states shown by the dot next to each workspace name:
- `Active` - When green, the agent in this workspace is currently processing a task
- `Idle` - When gray, the agent is idle and ready for a new task
- `Error` - When red, the agent has encountered an error and needs to be reset or restarted

<Note>Each workspace maintains its own agent chat history and context, independent of other workspaces. Model data is synced across all workspaces.</Note>
