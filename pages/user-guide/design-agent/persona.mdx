title: Personas & Background
---

Personas and User Background allow you to customize how the Davinci Agent interacts with you and performs tasks. Personas provide specific instructions to guide agent behavior, while User Background gives the agent context about your role and perspective in the project.

## Personas

Personas are reusable instruction sets that modify how the agent approaches tasks. Each persona provides consistent context to the agent with every message, allowing you to customize agent behavior for different workflows without repeating instructions.

### Persona Structure

Each persona consists of three components:

**Name**: A label for identifying the persona in the dropdown menu. This is visible to you but not sent to the agent.

**Purpose**: Describes the overall goal or what the agent should be trying to accomplish. This should align with or complement the goals you specify in your prompts—conflicting purposes may confuse the agent.

**Approach**: Specific instructions for how the agent should execute tasks. Use this section to:
- Provide step-by-step methodologies
- Prohibit certain actions or approaches
- Define quality standards or constraints
- Specify formatting or documentation requirements

### Using Personas

You can quickly switch between personas from the Agent view using the dropdown menu. The currently selected persona will be applied to all subsequent messages sent to the agent.

<Note>Become familiar with a persona before using it to ensure you understand what instructions will be included alongside your prompts.</Note>

**Example Persona Use Cases:**
- **Detailed Designer**: Ensures thorough documentation and traceability for all generated elements
- **Rapid Prototyper**: Prioritizes speed and iteration over completeness
- **Requirements Analyst**: Focuses on verification, validation, and requirement satisfaction
- **Documentation Writer**: Emphasizes clear explanations and comprehensive descriptions

### Managing Personas

More detailed persona management is available in [Project Settings](/pages/user-guide/navigating/project). From there you can:

- **View** all available personas in the project
- **Create** new personas with custom instructions
- **Edit** existing personas to refine their purpose and approach
- **Delete** personas that are no longer needed

### Persona Storage and Scope

Personas are stored **per-user, per-project**. This means:
- Each user has their own list of personas
- Personas are unique to each project
- Other users cannot see or use your personas unless you share them

### Importing and Exporting Personas

Personas can be exported as `.dmo` files and imported into other projects:

**To export a persona:**
1. Navigate to Project Settings
2. Select the persona you want to export
3. Click the export button
4. Save the `.dmo` file

**To import a persona:**
1. Open the destination project
2. Upload the `.dmo` file directly into the project (drag-and-drop or upload button)
3. Davinci will recognize it as a persona and automatically add it to your persona list

This is useful for reusing effective personas across multiple projects or sharing successful persona configurations with team members.

### Version Control

Personas are tracked by [Version Control](/pages/user-guide/right-panel/version-control) just like model objects. This means:

- Different branches may have different personas available
- The same persona may have different configurations on different branches
- Merge conflicts can occur if a persona is edited on multiple branches before merging

When merging branches, review any persona conflicts carefully to ensure the correct version is preserved.

## User Background

User Background allows you to specify your role, discipline, and perspective within the project. This helps the agent understand what angle you're approaching the work from and what aspects you're likely to care about.

### Setting Your Background

Describe your position, expertise, and focus areas. For example:
- "Mechanical Engineer focused on thermal analysis and structural design"
- "Systems Engineer responsible for requirements management and verification"
- "Project Manager overseeing schedule, budget, and stakeholder communication"
- "Electrical Engineer specializing in power systems and circuit design"

**To edit your background:**
1. Type in the User Background text box
2. Click the **Save** button to save your changes

<Warning>If you navigate away from the page without clicking Save, your background changes will not be updated.</Warning>

### Background Storage

Like personas, User Background is stored **per-user, per-project**. Each user can set their own background for each project they work on, allowing the agent to provide personalized, role-appropriate assistance.

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Personas

- **Be specific**: Vague instructions lead to inconsistent results
- **Test and iterate**: Try your persona on sample tasks and refine as needed
- **Keep purpose aligned**: Make sure the persona's purpose complements your typical prompts
- **Document approach clearly**: List specific do's and don'ts for the agent

### Using Personas Effectively

- **Match persona to task**: Switch personas based on what you're working on
- **Review before use**: Check the persona's instructions to avoid conflicts with your prompt
- **Don't over-constrain**: Too many restrictions can limit the agent's effectiveness

### Setting Your Background

- **Include relevant expertise**: Mention your technical background and specializations
- **Describe your role**: Explain your responsibilities in the project
- **Update as needed**: Your background can change as your role evolves in different projects
