title: Collaboration Overview

## Description

Davinci's collaboration features enable multiple team members to work together on the same project simultaneously. Real-time synchronization keeps everyone's view of the model current, while intelligent locking mechanisms prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity.

Collaboration in Davinci goes beyond simple file sharing—it provides a truly concurrent modeling environment where engineers, designers, and stakeholders can contribute to the same system model without stepping on each other's toes.

## What Collaboration Enables

### Simultaneous Multi-User Editing

Multiple users can work on different parts of the model at the same time. While one team member defines requirements, another can work on the design, and a third can update documentation—all within the same project session.

### Real-Time Updates

Changes made by any collaborator propagate to all other active users almost instantly. When someone updates an attribute value, adds a new component, or modifies a document, everyone else sees the change within seconds.

### Automatic Conflict Prevention

Davinci's locking system ensures that only one person can edit a specific object or document block at a time. This prevents the conflicts and merge issues common in traditional file-based collaboration.

### Shared Agent Access

The Davinci agent is available to all collaborators. Any team member can ask the agent to perform tasks, generate content, or answer questions about the model.

## Benefits of Collaborative Modeling

**Accelerated Development**: Team members work in parallel rather than sequentially, dramatically reducing project timelines.

**Improved Communication**: Everyone sees the same up-to-date model, eliminating confusion from outdated files and email attachments.

**Better Decision Making**: Stakeholders can review and provide input on the live model, enabling faster iteration and feedback cycles.

**Reduced Errors**: Real-time validation and automatic synchronization eliminate manual merge steps and the errors they introduce.

**Seamless Handoffs**: No need to "check out" files or worry about who has the latest version. The model is always current and accessible.

## Getting Started with Collaboration

### Setting Up Collaborators

1. Open your project in Davinci
2. Navigate to Project Settings > Collaborators
3. Click "Add Collaborator" and enter the email address
4. The invited user receives an email with an invitation link
5. Once they accept, they can access the project immediately

See [Collaboration Settings](/pages/user-guide/project-settings/collaboration) for detailed information on managing team members and permissions.

### Working Together

Once collaborators are added:
- All team members open the same project in Davinci
- Everyone sees the same model structure and content
- Updates from any user appear to others automatically
- Object locks prevent simultaneous editing of the same element

### Collaboration Features

**Real-Time Editing**: Learn about how updates propagate and what you can see from other users in [Real-Time Editing](/pages/user-guide/collaboration/real-time-editing).

**Object Locking**: Understand how Davinci prevents editing conflicts in [Object Locking](/pages/user-guide/collaboration/object-locking).

## Best Practices

**Communicate Verbally**: While Davinci handles the technical synchronization, verbal communication helps coordinate who's working on what.

**Use Comments**: Leave comments in the model to communicate context and decisions to team members.

**Define Workstreams**: Organize work so team members focus on different areas of the model when possible.

**Regular Sync Points**: Have quick check-ins to ensure everyone's work is integrating smoothly.

**Leverage the Agent**: Use the agent to generate first drafts or boilerplate content, letting team members focus on refinement and technical depth.

## Collaboration vs Version Control

Collaboration and version control serve different purposes:

**Collaboration** enables simultaneous work within a single project version. Multiple users edit, and changes sync in real-time.

**Version Control** manages different project states over time through snapshots and branches. Learn more in [Version Control](/pages/user-guide/right-panel/version-control).

You can use both together: Collaborate in real-time on a branch, then create snapshots of major milestones.

<Info>Collaboration requires all users to have Davinci accounts and be added as project collaborators. Guest or view-only access is not currently supported.</Info>
