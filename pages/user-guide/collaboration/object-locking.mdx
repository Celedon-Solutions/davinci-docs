title: Object Locking
---

## Description

Object locking allows you to protect important objects from accidental or unauthorized changes. When you lock an object from the Properties view, it becomes read-only for all users and the Davinci Agent until explicitly unlocked by a user. This feature is essential for maintaining the integrity of approved designs, baseline requirements, and other critical model elements.

## What Object Locking Does

- The object becomes completely read-only
- All properties, attributes, and values cannot be modified
- All children of the locked object are also locked
- Neither users nor the Davinci Agent can edit the object or its contents until unlocked by a user

## How to Lock Objects

### Locking an Object

From the Properties view:

1. Open the object you want to lock
2. In the name header at the top of the Properties view, locate the lock icon
3. Click the lock icon (appears as an open padlock)
4. The lock icon changes to a closed padlock
5. The object and all its children are now locked

### Unlocking an Object

To unlock a previously locked object:

1. Open the locked object in Properties view
2. Click the closed lock icon in the name header
3. The lock icon changes back to an open padlock
4. The object and its children are now editable again

<Warning>Only users with appropriate permissions can lock and unlock objects. Once locked, the object cannot be edited by anyone until unlocked.</Warning>

## What Gets Locked

### The Object Itself

All properties of the locked object become read-only:
- Name and short name
- Documentation
- Type-specific fields (values, equations, etc.)
- Attributes and constraints
- Relationships

### All Children Objects

Locking cascades down the hierarchy:
- All objects contained within the locked object are also locked
- Children cannot be edited, moved, or deleted
- New children cannot be added to locked objects
- The entire subtree becomes read-only

**Example**: If you lock a Part object, all attributes, constraints, ports, and child parts within it also become locked.
