title: Object Locking
---

## Description

Object locking allows you to protect important objects from accidental or unauthorized changes. When you lock an object from the Properties view, it becomes read-only for all users, including yourself, until explicitly unlocked. This feature is essential for maintaining the integrity of approved designs, baseline requirements, and other critical model elements.

## What Object Locking Does

### Prevents All Editing

When you lock an object:
- The object becomes completely read-only
- All properties, attributes, and values cannot be modified
- All children of the locked object are also locked
- Neither users nor the Davinci Agent can edit the object or its contents until unlocked

### Protects Model Integrity

Locking serves several important purposes:
- **Baseline Protection**: Freeze approved designs at specific milestones
- **Requirements Control**: Prevent changes to approved requirements
- **Change Management**: Control when and how critical elements can be modified
- **Accidental Changes**: Protect important objects from unintended modifications

### Visual Indication

Locked objects are clearly marked:
- Lock icon appears next to the object name
- Lock icon visible in the index/tree
- Locked objects appear disabled when attempting to edit
- Tooltips indicate the object is locked

## How to Lock Objects

### Locking an Object

From the Properties view:

1. Open the object you want to lock
2. In the name header at the top of the Properties view, locate the lock icon
3. Click the lock icon (appears as an open padlock)
4. The lock icon changes to a closed padlock
5. The object and all its children are now locked

### Unlocking an Object

To unlock a previously locked object:

1. Open the locked object in Properties view
2. Click the closed lock icon in the name header
3. The lock icon changes back to an open padlock
4. The object and its children are now editable again

<Warning>Only users with appropriate permissions can lock and unlock objects. Once locked, the object cannot be edited by anyone until unlocked.</Warning>

## What Gets Locked

### The Object Itself

All properties of the locked object become read-only:
- Name and short name
- Documentation
- Type-specific fields (values, equations, etc.)
- Attributes and constraints
- Relationships

### All Children Objects

Locking cascades down the hierarchy:
- All objects contained within the locked object are also locked
- Children cannot be edited, moved, or deleted
- New children cannot be added to locked objects
- The entire subtree becomes read-only

**Example**: If you lock a Part object, all attributes, constraints, ports, and child parts within it also become locked.

## Common Use Cases

### Baseline Management

Lock objects that represent approved baselines:
- Approved requirements that have passed review
- Design configurations that have been validated
- Test procedures that have been verified
- Documentation that has been released

### Milestone Freezing

At project milestones, lock relevant portions of the model:
- Preliminary Design Review (PDR) baseline
- Critical Design Review (CDR) baseline
- Requirements freeze before implementation
- Interface specifications after agreement

### Critical Element Protection

Protect high-stakes model elements:
- Safety-critical requirements
- Regulatory compliance constraints  
- Interface definitions between teams
- Key performance parameters

### Preventing Accidental Changes

Lock objects that shouldn't be modified during routine work:
- Standard templates and libraries
- Reference designs
- Shared component specifications
- Project-wide constants

## Working with Locked Objects

### Viewing Locked Objects

You can still view locked objects normally:
- Open in any view (Properties, Tree, etc.)
- Read all properties and documentation
- View relationships and connections
- Export data

### What You Cannot Do

With locked objects, you cannot:
- Edit any properties or values
- Add or remove children
- Delete the object
- Move the object to a different location
- Create relationships to/from the object (in some cases)

### Requesting Changes

If you need to modify a locked object:
- Contact the person who locked it (if known)
- Discuss the change through team communication
- Unlock the object (if you have permission)
- Make necessary changes
- Re-lock if appropriate

## Lock Management Best Practices

**Lock Purposefully**: Only lock objects that genuinely need protection. Over-locking makes the model inflexible.

**Document Lock Reasons**: Add comments or documentation explaining why an object is locked and under what conditions it can be unlocked.

**Communicate Locks**: Inform team members when locking shared objects to prevent confusion.

**Review Periodically**: Regularly review locked objects to ensure they still need protection.

**Unlock When Appropriate**: Don't leave objects locked longer than necessary. Unlock when the protection period ends.

**Lock at Right Level**: Lock at the appropriate hierarchy level—locking too high affects too many objects, too low provides insufficient protection.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Edit an Object

If you cannot edit an object:
1. Check for a lock icon next to the object name
2. Check if a parent object is locked (child objects inherit locks)
3. Verify you have edit permissions for the project
4. Try unlocking the object if you locked it

### Cannot Unlock an Object

If the unlock button doesn't work:
- Verify you have the necessary permissions
- Check if someone else locked it (permissions may restrict unlocking)
- Contact a project owner or administrator
- Refresh the browser and try again

### Locked by Mistake

If you accidentally locked an object:
- Simply click the lock icon again to unlock it
- Changes take effect immediately
- No harm done—locking and unlocking are reversible

<Note>Object locking is a manual action—objects do not lock automatically. You must explicitly click the lock icon to protect an object.</Note>

## Lock Permissions

Lock permissions depend on your project role:

**Project Owners**: Can lock and unlock any object
**Collaborators**: Can typically lock and unlock objects they created or have permission to edit
**View-Only Users**: Cannot lock or unlock objects (cannot edit at all)
