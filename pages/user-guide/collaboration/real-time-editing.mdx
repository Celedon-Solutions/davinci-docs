title: Real-Time Editing
---

## Description

Real-time editing in Davinci means that changes made by any collaborator are visible to all other active users within seconds. This creates a truly concurrent modeling environment where team members can work together as if they were all looking at the same screen.

## How Real-Time Updates Work

### Update Propagation

When a user makes a change to the model:

1. **Local Change**: The change is applied immediately in the user's browser
2. **Server Sync**: The change is sent to the Davinci server
3. **Broadcast**: The server broadcasts the change to all other active users
4. **Remote Update**: Other users' browsers receive and apply the update

This process typically completes in 1-3 seconds, depending on network conditions and the complexity of the change.

### What Gets Synchronized

Real-time synchronization applies to virtually all model changes:

- **Object Creation**: New objects appear in everyone's index
- **Property Updates**: Changes to names, documentation, values
- **Attribute Changes**: Value, unit, and equation modifications
- **Relationship Updates**: New connections or deleted relationships
- **Document Edits**: Text changes, formatting, block additions
- **Structure Changes**: Objects moved or reorganized
- **Deletions**: Removed objects disappear from all views

### What You See from Others

**Active Indicators**: Visual indicators may show which objects or sections other users are currently viewing or editing.

**Change Highlights**: Recently updated elements may be briefly highlighted to draw attention to changes.

**Lock Indicators**: Objects or blocks being edited by others show lock icons, preventing simultaneous editing.

## Working with Updates

### Receiving Updates

Updates from other users appear automatically:

- **Background Updates**: If you're viewing a different part of the model, updates happen silently
- **Visible Updates**: If you're viewing an object someone else modifies, you see the change appear
- **Edit Protection**: If you're editing something and someone else tries to edit it, they see it's locked

### Making Updates

Your changes are sent to other users the same way:

- **Immediate Feedback**: You see your changes instantly
- **Automatic Sync**: No "save" button needed—changes sync automatically
- **Network Resilience**: If your connection drops temporarily, changes queue and sync when reconnected

### Stale Data Prevention

Davinci prevents stale data issues common in traditional collaboration:

- No need to "refresh" to see latest changes
- No risk of overwriting someone else's work
- No manual merge processes
- No "which version is correct?" confusion

## Performance Considerations

### Large Team Collaboration

Davinci is designed to handle teams of various sizes:

- **Small Teams (2-5 users)**: Essentially no performance impact
- **Medium Teams (6-15 users)**: Minimal latency, typically unnoticeable
- **Large Teams (15+ users)**: May experience slightly longer update propagation times

### Network Requirements

For optimal real-time collaboration:

- **Bandwidth**: Modest requirements—typical updates are small
- **Latency**: Lower latency improves update speed
- **Stability**: Stable connections prevent queue buildup

### Heavy Edit Scenarios

During periods of intense simultaneous editing:

- Update frequency may increase
- Short delays (2-5 seconds) may occur
- System prioritizes data integrity over speed
- All changes are eventually synchronized

## Collaborative Workflows

### Divide and Conquer

Split work across model areas to minimize overlap:
- One person on requirements, another on design
- Different team members on different subsystems
- One person updating attributes while another writes documentation

### Sequential Handoffs

Pass work smoothly between team members:
- Designer completes component → Analyst adds attributes
- Requirements author finishes → Designer links to design elements
- No file handoff delays—next person can start immediately

### Parallel Refinement

Multiple people refining different aspects simultaneously:
- Technical content in documentation
- Visual layout in presentations
- Data accuracy in tables and matrices

### Review and Feedback

Stakeholders can review and comment in real-time:
- Open the model during a meeting
- Make changes as feedback is given
- Everyone sees updates immediately

## Troubleshooting

**Updates Not Appearing**: Check your network connection. If offline, changes will sync when reconnected.

**Unexpected Changes**: Another collaborator may be working in the same area. Check the collaborators list in project settings.

**Performance Issues**: If updates are slow, check your network speed and whether many users are editing simultaneously.

<Note>Real-time collaboration requires an active internet connection. Davinci queues changes when offline and syncs when connectivity is restored.</Note>

## Limits and Considerations

**Connection Required**: Collaboration requires internet access. Offline work is individual only.

**Concurrent Locks**: Only one user can edit a specific object or block at a time. See [Object Locking](/pages/user-guide/collaboration/object-locking).

**Large Operations**: Bulk operations (importing hundreds of objects) may cause brief delays for other users.

**Browser Performance**: Very large projects with many simultaneous users may require adequate browser resources (RAM, CPU).
