title: Dependencies
---

Dependencies allow you to extend the functionality of your [Code Objects](/pages/modeling/objects/code) by importing external Python libraries. These libraries are pulled from PyPI or a direct URL and made available to the project's Python environment.

## Managing Dependencies

### Adding Dependencies

To add a new library to your project:

1. Click the **New Dependency** button.
2. Enter the **PyPI package name** (e.g., `pandas`, `requests`) OR the **URL** pointing to a specific package distribution.
3. The system will attempt to resolve and install the package.

<Note>
Davinci runs Python code directly in the browser using a WebAssembly environment. Not all Python packages are compatible, particularly those that rely on C-extensions not compiled for WebAssembly (WASM).
</Note>

### Removing Dependencies

To remove a package that is no longer needed:
1. Find the package in the dependencies list.
2. Click the **trash can icon** on the right side of the row.

## Pre-installed Packages

Davinci comes with a set of commonly used scientific and utility packages pre-installed. You do not need to add these as dependencies.

See the [Code View documentation](/pages/user-guide/views/code#python-modules) for a full list of available pre-installed packages (including `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and more).

## Version Control

Dependencies are tracked as part of your project configuration in [Version Control](/pages/user-guide/right-panel/version-control). 

- **Branch Consistency**: Different branches can have different sets of installed dependencies. If code works on one branch but not another, check the Dependencies list to ensure required packages are installed.
- **Merging**: Dependency configurations are merged automatically. Unlike model objects, dependencies **cannot** generate merge conflicts; the system handles the reconciliation of package lists during a merge.
