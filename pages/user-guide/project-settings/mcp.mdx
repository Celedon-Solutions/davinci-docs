title: MCP Configuration
---

The MCP Configuration view allows you to connect external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to your project, extending your AI agent's capabilities with specialized tools and resources.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI agents to connect to external servers that provide specialized tools, data sources, and capabilities. MCP servers act as extensions to your agent, allowing it to interact with external services, databases, APIs, and custom functionality.

Common examples of MCP servers include:

- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- API integrations (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- File system access
- Web scraping tools
- Custom business logic servers

## Managing MCP Servers

### Adding an MCP Server

To add a new MCP server, click the **Add Server** button in the header.

You'll need to provide:

- **Server Name**: A friendly name for the server (e.g., "GitHub Integration")
- **Server URL**: The endpoint URL for the MCP server (e.g., `https://api.example.com/mcp`)
- **Description** (optional): A brief description of what the server does

<Note>
Server names and URLs must be unique within your project. You cannot add duplicate servers.
</Note>

### Connecting to a Server

After adding an MCP server, you'll need to connect to it before it can be used:

1. Locate the server in the MCP Servers table
2. Click the **Connect** button in the Status column
3. If the server requires OAuth authentication, a popup window will open for authorization
4. Once authenticated, the server will show as "Connected" with a green indicator

<Note>
Some MCP servers require OAuth authentication. The connection process will automatically handle the OAuth flow, opening a popup window for you to authorize access.
</Note>

### Enabling and Disabling Servers

Once connected, you can enable or disable an MCP server using the toggle in the Status column.

| Status | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `Enabled` | The server is active and its tools are available to the AI agent. |
| `Disabled` | The server is connected but its tools are temporarily unavailable. |

<Note>
You must connect to a server before you can enable it. Disconnected servers will show a "Connect" button instead of a toggle.
</Note>

### Viewing Server Status

The **State** column displays the current connection status and available tools for each server:

- **Connection Status**: Green dot indicates connected, red dot indicates disconnected
- **Tool Count**: Shows how many tools the server provides (e.g., "5 tools")

### Editing Server Details

To edit a server's configuration:

1. Hover over the server row to reveal action buttons
2. Click the edit icon on the right side
3. Update the server name, URL, or description
4. Click **Save** to apply changes

<Warning>
Changing a server's URL may require reconnecting to establish a new connection.
</Warning>

### Deleting Servers

To remove an MCP server:

1. Hover over the server row to reveal action buttons
2. Click the trash icon on the right side
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting an MCP server is permanent. The agent will no longer have access to that server's tools.
</Warning>

## Refreshing Server List

If you've made changes to MCP servers elsewhere or need to update the connection status, click the **Refresh** button to reload the server list.

## Using MCP Server Tools

Once an MCP server is connected and enabled, its tools automatically become available to your AI agent during conversations. The agent can discover and use these tools as needed to complete tasks.

You don't need to explicitly tell the agent which MCP tools to use—it will automatically select the appropriate tools based on the task context.

## Version Control and Conflicts

MCP server configurations are tracked by Davinci's version control system.

- **Branching**: Different branches can have different MCP server configurations
- **Conflicts**: If the same server is configured differently in two branches being merged, a conflict will occur
- **Resolution**: You must resolve any MCP server conflicts before you can add new servers. The interface will display the conflicting configurations side-by-side

<Note>
When merge conflicts exist for MCP servers, the "Add Server" button will be disabled until all conflicts are resolved.
</Note>

## MCP Server Table Columns

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status** | Shows connection button or enable/disable toggle depending on connection state. |
| **Server Details** | The server name and URL. Click to view more information. |
| **State** | Current connection status (connected/disconnected) and number of available tools. |
| **Actions** | Edit or delete the server (visible on hover). |
