title: Relationships

The Relationship Settings view allows you to manage and configure all relationship types in your project. Relationships define how different objects in your model connect and interact with each other, forming the structure and logic of your system model.

## Managing Relationships

### Searching Relationships

Use the search box in the header to filter relationships by name. The search updates in real-time as you type.

### Creating Custom Relationships

To create a new custom relationship:

1. Click the **New Relationship** button in the header
2. Configure the relationship properties:
   - **Name**: The identifier for the relationship
   - **Direction**: Unidirectional or bidirectional
   - **Color**: Visual color for diagrams
   - **Description**: Purpose and usage
   - **From**: Valid source object types
   - **To**: Valid target object types

### Editing Custom Relationships

Custom relationships can be edited directly in the table:

- **Direction**: Click the dropdown to switch between unidirectional and bidirectional
- **Color**: Click the color box to open the color picker
- **Description**: Click the description text to edit inline

<Note>
Only custom relationships can be edited. Base and internal relationships are read-only to maintain SysML v2 compatibility and system integrity.
</Note>

### Deleting Custom Relationships

To delete a custom relationship:

1. Hover over the relationship row
2. Click the trash icon that appears
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a relationship type will not automatically remove existing relationship instances from your model objects. Use the Clean Up feature to remove invalid relationships.
</Warning>

### Cleaning Up Relationships

The **Clean Up** button removes all invalid relationship instances from your model. This is useful when:

- You've deleted a relationship type
- Object types have changed
- Relationship constraints have been modified

Click **Clean Up** to scan all objects and remove relationships that no longer match valid relationship type definitions.

## Relationship Properties

Each relationship type displays the following properties:

- **Name**: The identifier of the relationship
- **Direction**: Whether the relationship is unidirectional or bidirectional
- **Color**: The visual color used to represent this relationship in diagrams and views
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the relationship's purpose
- **From**: The types of objects that can be the source of this relationship (displayed as bubbles with icons)
- **To**: The types of objects that can be the target (displayed as bubbles with icons)

<Note>
When a relationship shows "ALL" in the From or To column, it can connect to any object type.
</Note>

## Relationship Categories

Relationships are organized into three categories, displayed in separate tables:

### Custom Relationships

User-created relationships specific to your project needs. These are fully editable and can be deleted.

**Examples**: `Thermal`, `Power`, `Chemical`, `Mechanical`

Custom relationships provide specialized modeling capabilities for physical and logical interactions beyond standard SysML v2.

### Base Relationships (SysML v2)

Standard relationships defined by the SysML v2 specification. These relationships are read-only to ensure your model remains compatible with standard systems engineering practices and can be exported to valid SysML v2 formats.

These relationships cannot be edited or deleted.

### Internal Relationships

System-managed relationships that Davinci creates automatically to maintain model connectivity and structure. These relationships are read-only.

**Examples**:
- `Uses`: Automatically created when an Attribute references another Attribute in its equation
- `Reference`: Links Reference objects to other model elements

Internal relationships cannot be edited or deleted.
