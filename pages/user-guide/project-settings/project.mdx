title: Summary

Project Settings has many different views that show useful information and configuration options for your Project.

Project Settings is now a content Tab, just like Model Objects, making it easy to browse your configuration settings alongside the rest of your model.

## Summary
The Model Summary Tab contains statistics about your Model and various Model Health Indicators. 

At the top are three global statistics of your Model:
1. `Total Elements`: This gives you the total number of Objects in your Model.
2. `Depth`: This gives you the maximum depth of your Model. How many layers are in your Model. 
3. `Average Connectedness`: This stat tells you, on average, how many Object connections a given Model Object is likely to have. In our screenshot below, the average Object in our Model is connected to 0.6 other Objects.

### Object Type Distribution
The Object Type Distribution graph is a visual representation of the elements that make up your Model. It also includes a statistical breakdown of the elements in your model.

Click on `Details` to get a tabluated view of the statistics.

### Relationship Types
Relationship Types shows you a total count of all Relationships in your Model. This should help give you a broad idea of how connected your Model components are to each other. They are broken down by Relationship Type.

Click on `Details` to get a list view of the statistics.

### Model Health
The Model Health graph shows three summary metrics for your Model. 
1. `Documentation`: This shows the percentage of Model Objects that have data in their Documentation field.
2. `Completeness`: This statistic represents the validity of the data within the Model. Higher Completeness indicates valid, resolved data fields within Attributes and Constraints, and satisfied conditions for Requirements.
3. `Validation`: Validation indicates how much of the Model is connected to other sources of data. Including documentation Reference Objects, referencing Attributes or other Objects, and Locking elements after reviewing them all contribute to a higher Validation Score.

Click on `Details` to get a tabluated view of the statistics. Click `Open Live View` to pop the table out into a new window. This is convenient for quickly navigating your Model to correct any issues.

### Export Model
The Export Model section allows you to export your Model in 3 different formats:

1. `Davinci Archive Format (.DAF)`: .DAF is the best way to export a Davinci model for archive, storage, or sharing with other Davinci users without collaboration. .DAF exports both regular model objects, as well as uploaded reference files. It is a true 1:1 export of the entire model.
2. `JSON`: Export your Model entirely in JSON. JSON exporting will not include uploaded reference files. Only non-reference model object types will be included in this export.
3. `SysML v2`: Export your Model in the standard SysML v2 standard format. Useful when interfacing with other tools that rely on SysML formatting to process data.

<Warning>
The SysML v2 export feature is in beta and does not fully support all features or object types yet.
</Warning>
