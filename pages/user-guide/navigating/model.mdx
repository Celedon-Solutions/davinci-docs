title: The Model Area
---
The Model Area is where all Model interaction happens. From here, you can browse your Model, view elements, make edits, and delete Objects.

## Focus

The Model Area uses a `Focus` system to determine where shortcut actions, such as Paste or Undo, will occur. The Focused section is highlighted in Purple, and can either be a Tab, or the Index. When performing actions such as Undo or Paste, they will be performed on the Focused section.

## Index
The index holds the list of all objects in the project. The two index tabs can be expanded or contracted to navigate the index.

To add objects, rename, copy, and other similar functions simply right click the index for an action popout menu. To re-arrange objects in the Index, simply click and drag the Object to a new location in the Index.

To hide or show the index, click the Hide/Show Index button.

### Filtering
The Index can be filtered using the Filter icon in the top right of each section. This can be useful if you only want to see a specific subset of items.


### Library

The Library section of the Index houses all of your Reference Documentation and Uploaded Files by default. These Objects are used as truth sources within your model and are directly referenced by Model Objects. Reference Objects can be moved to the Model Index section manually as desired.

Add Reference Objects and Files by dragging them from your computer into the Chat Line or from the Files tab in the Project Area.



### Model

The Model section of the Index is where your Model Objects live. These are the Objects that you will create and edit to form a comprehensive Model of your System. Model Objects can be organized into Packages for easier navigation.

<Note>Some object types can not be children of other types, which can prevent dragging and dropping behavior if the hierarchy is not valid.</Note>

#### Locked Objects
Model Objects can be Locked to prevent editing by both users and Davinci. Objects can be locked or unlocked by right-clicking them in the Index, or within the Object Workspace. Locking or Unlocking an Object also locks or unlocks all child-Objects.




## Workspace
The Workspace is where you will view and edit objects directly. Selecting Objects in the Index will open them as Tabs inside the Workspace.

</Frame>

Tabs can be rearranged by dragging them around. The Workspace can also be split to view multiple Tabs at once. Drag a tab into the Workspace and drop it on the left or right side to create a new Workspace Pane to display Tabs side by side.


Each open object in the workspace will have its focus indicated by the purple highlight. Inside the selected workspace tab is a side panel which allows you to select the view types. Each view will show the object (and its content) in different ways or provide editing options. 

In the bottom of the side panel is the download button which allows you to export the render or data of the view. 

<Note>Exports are an early feature and still have limitations.</Note>




## The Right Panel
The Right Panel is where you can interact with the Davinci design agent and view key insights into the current state of your model.
