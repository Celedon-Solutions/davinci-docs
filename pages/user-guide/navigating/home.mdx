## Project list
The Project List is where Projects are initially loaded. Each Project will be listed with a Project Name and Project ID.

There are two key areas in the Project List:

1. `Owned`: Projects in the Owned list were created and are Owned by you. These Projects contribute to your overall Storage usage and can be renamed and deleted at any time.
2. `Shared`: Shared Projects are Owned by another Davinci User that you are a Collaborator on. These Projects do not contribute to your Storage usage and cannot be permanantely deleted by you.

### Create a Project
1. Click `New Project` to create a new Project.
2. A Project will be added to the Owned Project list with no name. Begin typing to give it a name.
3. Press Enter to confirm the name. Davinci will then generate the new Project. Once a Project ID is assigned, the Project is ready to open.

### Import a Project
1. Click `Import Project`.
2. Upload an exported project, either in .DAF or .JSON format
3. Davinci will process and import the project, then open it in the workspace

<Note>Projects exported and imported using .DAF will retain all Reference Objects, whereas .JSON exports will not</Note>
