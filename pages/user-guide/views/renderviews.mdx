title: Render Views

Beyond the main views that enable extensive editing, several additional views provide unique ways to display data, helping to better understand the model and its context. These views are summarized below.

### Table View
The Table View presents summary tables of objects, organizing them by rows based on object type (including their descendant paths). Different fields or child objects can be toggled for display. Indentation represents parent-child relationships and their depth.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_table.jpg" />  
</Frame>

The depth level, along with the selection of fields or children to display across columns, can be configured in the top header bar.

### Tree View
The Tree View provides a hierarchical breakdown of the object's descendant tree. For each block in the tree, you can toggle the display of related owned objects or accompanying documentation.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_tree.jpg" />  
</Frame>

### Equation Rollup View
For attributes, the tree does not represent owned attributes but rather the referenced values used in equations. It visualizes the roll-up tree that determines the attribute values.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_rollup.jpg" />  
</Frame>

### Block View
The Block View illustrates relationships between different parts and any port interfaces between them in a block diagram format.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_block.jpg" />  
</Frame>

<Note>Relationships at lower-level children will infer connections when viewing upper level objects. These inferred relationships are shown with dotted lines.</Note>

<Note>Only relationships that specifically exist between parts are displayed in this view.</Note>

### Pie Chart View
The Pie Chart View shows the breakdown of child Resource objects compared to their total amount. Use this to view what proportion of a Resource is being used where.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_pie.jpg" />  
</Frame>

### Connectome View
The Connectome View visualizes relationships between objects in a 3D space, based on the number of connections and their density. You can specify the depth relative to the focus object.

<Frame>
    <img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_render_thread.jpg" />  
</Frame>


The home button will focus the space onto the object it is rendered from.
