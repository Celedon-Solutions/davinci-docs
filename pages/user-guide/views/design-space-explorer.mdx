The Design Space Explorer is an interactive tool that allows you to explore how changing input parameters affects computed values throughout your model, without permanently modifying your data.

## Overview

The Design Space Explorer creates an interactive sandbox where you can adjust independent variables using sliders and immediately see how those changes propagate through dependent calculations. This enables rapid "what-if" analysis and design space exploration without committing changes to your model.

All changes made in the Design Space Explorer are temporary and local until you explicitly apply them to your model.

## View Layout

The Design Space Explorer uses a two-panel layout:

### Left Panel: Independent Variables

The left panel displays attributes that have no dependencies (independent variables). These are the inputs you can control:

- **Sliders**: Adjust values by dragging sliders
- **Direct Input**: Type exact values into input fields
- **Range Configuration**: Min, max, and step values are automatically determined based on the current value

**Intermediate Variables** section (collapsible):
- Shows upstream dependent variables that have their own dependencies
- These update automatically based on independent variable changes
- Cannot be directly adjusted (they're computed from other values)

### Right Panel: Dependent Variables

The right panel displays:

- **Focused Object**: The main attribute you're exploring (shown at top if it has dependencies)
- **Downstream Dependents**: All objects that depend on the focused object
- Values update in real-time as you adjust sliders

## How It Works

The Design Space Explorer:

1. Analyzes the dependency graph for the focused object
2. Identifies independent variables (leaves with no dependencies)
3. Identifies dependent variables (nodes that rely on others)
4. Creates an isolated computation environment
5. Recalculates values locally as you adjust sliders
6. Shows real-time propagation of changes through the dependency chain

<Note>
All calculations happen locally in your browser. No changes are saved to the database until you apply them.

## Using the Design Space Explorer

### Adjusting Values

1. **Drag Sliders**: Move the slider handle to adjust values continuously
2. **Type Values**: Click the value display to type exact numbers
3. **Observe Changes**: Watch dependent values update in real-time

### Applying Changes

When you find a desirable configuration:

1. Review the updated values in both panels
2. Click the **Apply Changes** button (if available)
3. Changes will be committed to your model

### Resetting Changes

To discard all changes and return to original values:
- Close the Design Space Explorer view
- All temporary changes are discarded automatically

## Supported Object Types

The Design Space Explorer works with:
- **Attributes** with numeric values and equations
- Objects that have attribute dependencies
- Parametric models with equation-based relationships

## Use Cases

**Design Optimization**: Explore different parameter combinations to find optimal designs.

**Trade-Off Analysis**: Understand how changes in one parameter affect multiple dependent values.

**Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify which input parameters have the most significant impact on outputs.

**Constraint Validation**: Verify that parameter changes stay within acceptable ranges.

**What-If Scenarios**: Test hypothetical configurations without modifying your model.

## Limitations

- Only works with numeric attributes and constraints
- Requires evaluatable equations (not TBD or error states)
- Changes are temporary until explicitly applied
- Complex circular dependencies may not be supported

<Note>
The Design Space Explorer is most effective when working with well-structured parametric models where dependencies are clearly defined through equations.
