## Description

The Geometric View provides a 3D visualization and editing environment for Geometry objects. This view uses a three-pane layout with code editor, 3D viewer, and output terminal, supporting both programmatic geometry definition and imported CAD files.

The left pane contains a code editor for defining geometry using a scripting language, the middle pane displays a 3D rendering of the geometry, and the right pane shows compilation output and messages.

## View Controls

### Code Editor (Left Pane)

For script-based geometries, define 3D shapes, assemblies, and operations using geometry scripting syntax. The editor provides syntax highlighting and auto-completion.

For STEP file imports, the left pane displays information about the imported geometry instead of a code editor.

### Wrap

Toggle line wrapping in the code editor for better readability of long lines.

### Compile

Generates the 3D geometry from your script code. This validates your geometry definition and reports any errors in the terminal pane. The compiled geometry appears in the 3D viewer.

### Wireframe Mode

Toggle between visualization modes:
- **Solid**: Shaded 3D geometry with surfaces
- **Wireframe**: Line rendering showing edges and structure
- **Transparent**: Semi-transparent surfaces with visible internal structure

### 3D Viewer (Middle Pane)

Displays the rendered 3D geometry with interactive controls.

**Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate the view around the geometry.

**Pan**: Right-click and drag (or Shift + click and drag) to pan the view.

**Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

**Home**: Reset view to default position and zoom level.

### Output Terminal (Right Pane)

Shows compilation messages, errors, geometry statistics, and other output from geometry operations.

## Geometry Definition

Geometry scripts can include:
- **Primitive Shapes**: Boxes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and other basic shapes
- **Boolean Operations**: Union, intersection, subtraction to combine shapes
- **Transformations**: Translation, rotation, scaling, and mirroring
- **Imported Geometry**: Reference to external CAD files or other geometry objects

## Supported Formats

**Script-Based**: Define geometry programmatically using built-in geometry language.

**STEP Files**: Import standard ISO 10303 STEP CAD files for viewing and integration.

## Use Cases

**3D Modeling**: Create parametric 3D geometry for parts, assemblies, and systems directly within Davinci.

**CAD Integration**: Import STEP files from external CAD tools and integrate them into system models with associated properties and relationships.
