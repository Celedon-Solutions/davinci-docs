The Reference View is unique to Reference Objects and displays details of the Reference Object, which vary depending on the reference file type:
- **Text or simple data objects (CSV, JSON)** are rendered as raw text.
- **PDF files** are displayed using a PDF viewer.

This View allows you to browse your Reference Objects from within Davinci.

## Export Options

Reference objects can be exported in their original file format.

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Native Format | Download the original uploaded file (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, image, etc.) |

Exporting preserves the exact file that was imported, allowing you to share or use the reference outside of Davinci.
