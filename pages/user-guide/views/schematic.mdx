## Description

The Schematic View provides an interactive environment for creating and editing circuit schematics for Circuit and Component objects. This view uses a three-pane layout with code editor, schematic canvas, and output terminal.

The left pane contains a code editor where you define circuit components, connections, and attributes using a specialized circuit description language. The middle pane displays the rendered schematic diagram, and the right pane shows output from simulation or compilation operations.

## View Controls

### Code Editor (Left Pane)

Define your circuit structure using component and connection syntax. The editor provides syntax highlighting for circuit-specific keywords and auto-completion for component types.

### Wrap

Toggle line wrapping in the code editor for better readability.

### Compile

Generates the schematic diagram from your circuit code. This also validates your circuit definition and reports any errors in the terminal pane.

### Run/Simulate

Executes circuit simulation if simulation parameters are defined. Results appear in the output terminal.

### Schematic Canvas (Middle Pane)

Displays the rendered schematic diagram. Components are automatically placed and routed based on your code definition.

**Pan and Zoom**: Click and drag to pan around the schematic. Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

**Click Components**: Click on components in the diagram to highlight them in the code editor, making it easy to find and edit specific elements.

### Output Terminal (Right Pane)

Shows compilation messages, errors, simulation results, and other output from circuit operations. Use this to debug circuit definitions and interpret simulation results.

## Circuit Definition

Circuit code typically includes:
- **Component Declarations**: Define resistors, capacitors, transistors, ICs, and other components
- **Connections**: Specify how component pins connect to nets or other components
- **Attributes**: Set component values, ratings, and parameters
- **Simulation Directives**: Configure analysis types and simulation parameters

## Use Cases

**Circuit Design**: Create and document electronic circuit designs with proper component specifications and connections.

**Simulation Setup**: Define circuits for electrical simulation and analysis using standard SPICE-like syntax.
