The Help View provides quick, contextual information about the current object type, including its purpose, usage guidelines, and relationships to other objects in your model.

## Overview

The Help View appears as a tab in your workspace and automatically displays information specific to the object you're working with. It serves as a quick reference guide to understand what an object type is, how to use it effectively, and how it relates to other parts of your model.

## Structure

Each Help View contains three main sections:

### Definition

Explains what the object type is and its fundamental purpose in the modeling system. This section provides a clear, concise description of the object type's role and characteristics.

### Usage

Describes how to use the object type effectively, including:
- What properties or fields are available
- How to configure and customize the object
- Common use cases and applications
- Best practices for implementation

This section helps you understand the practical application of the object type in your model.

### Relation to Other Objects

Details how the object type connects to and interacts with other object types in your model. This includes:
- Parent-child relationships
- Which objects can contain this type
- Which objects this type can contain
- Cross-references and dependencies
- Associated object types

Understanding these relationships helps you build coherent model structures and trace dependencies.

## View Full Documentation

At the bottom of each Help View, you'll find a **View Full Documentation** button that opens the comprehensive documentation for that object type on the Davinci documentation website. This provides access to in-depth information, advanced features, examples, and detailed specifications beyond the quick reference provided in the Help View.
