title: Sequence View

## Description

The Sequence View displays sequence diagrams for Action objects, showing interactions and message exchanges between different entities over time. This view uses a two-pane layout with code editor on the left and generated diagram on the right.

</Frame>

Sequence diagrams visualize how objects interact in a time-ordered sequence, with lifelines representing participants and arrows showing messages or calls between them. The view automatically generates these diagrams from your sequence definition code.

## View Controls

### Code Editor

The left pane contains a code editor where you define the sequence interactions using structured syntax. The diagram updates automatically as you edit the code.

### Wrap

Toggle line wrapping in the code editor for better readability of long lines.

### Depth

Controls how deep into nested interactions and sub-sequences the diagram displays.

### Orientation

Choose between horizontal and vertical layout for the sequence diagram.

### Show Documentation

Toggle to display or hide documentation text for interactions within the diagram.

### Refresh

Regenerates the sequence diagram from the current code definition.

## Diagram Elements

Sequence diagrams include:
- **Lifelines**: Vertical dashed lines representing entities or objects participating in the sequence
- **Messages**: Horizontal arrows between lifelines showing communication or calls
- **Activation Boxes**: Rectangles on lifelines indicating when an entity is actively processing
- **Return Messages**: Dashed arrows showing return values or responses
- **Time Flow**: Implicit top-to-bottom ordering represents progression of time

## Interaction

**Pan and Zoom**: In the diagram pane, click and drag to pan. Use mouse wheel to zoom.

**Edit Code**: Modify the sequence definition in the left pane to change interactions and message flows.

## Use Cases

**Interface Documentation**: Document API calls, method interactions, and communication protocols between system components.

**Scenario Modeling**: Illustrate how different parts of a system collaborate to accomplish specific use cases or scenarios.
