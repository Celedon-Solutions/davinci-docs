## Description

The Table View presents summary tables of objects, organizing them by rows based on object type and their hierarchical paths. This view provides a structured, data-focused perspective of your model with configurable columns showing different fields or child objects.

Objects are listed in rows with indentation representing parent-child relationships and their depth within the model hierarchy. Columns can be customized to display various object properties, attributes, or relationships.

## View Controls

### Depth

Controls how many levels deep into the object hierarchy the table displays. Increase depth to see more nested children, or decrease it to focus on top-level objects only.

### Field Selection

Choose which fields or child object types to display as columns in the table. Common options include:
- Object name
- Documentation
- Attribute values
- Constraint status
- Custom properties
- Related objects

### Column Configuration

Click column headers to add or remove columns from the table. Each column can represent a different field type or property, allowing you to create customized views of your model data.

### Sorting

Click column headers to sort the table by that column's values. This helps identify patterns, find outliers, or organize information logically.

## Table Structure

**Indentation**: Each level of hierarchy is indented, making it easy to see parent-child relationships at a glance.

**Object Types**: Objects are grouped by type (requirements, parts, attributes, etc.) and marked with type icons.

**Expandable Rows**: Rows with children can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide nested objects.

## Use Cases

**Data Review**: Examine large sets of objects in a structured, spreadsheet-like format for easy comparison and analysis.

**Requirements Tracing**: Create tables showing requirements linked to design elements, with columns for status, verification, and other tracking fields.

## Export Options

Table view data can be exported for external analysis.
