## Description

The Tree View provides a hierarchical breakdown of an object's descendant tree, showing the complete parent-child structure of model elements. This view displays objects in an expandable tree format, making it easy to navigate complex hierarchies.

Each node in the tree represents an object, and expanding a node reveals its children. For each object, you can optionally display related owned objects (attributes, constraints, ports) or accompanying documentation.

## View Controls

### Depth

Controls how many levels deep into the hierarchy the tree initially displays. You can manually expand or collapse nodes beyond this depth as needed.

### Show Documentation

Toggle to display or hide documentation text for each object in the tree. When enabled, documentation appears below or alongside each tree node.

### Show Related Objects

Toggle visibility of related owned objects for each node:
- Attributes
- Constraints
- Ports
- Other owned elements

This allows you to see not just the structural hierarchy, but also the properties and connections of each object.

## Tree Structure

**Expand/Collapse**: Click the arrow icon next to any node to expand or collapse its children.

**Object Icons**: Each node displays the appropriate icon for its object type (part, requirement, attribute, etc.).

**Click to Open**: Click on any object name to open that object in a new workspace tab.

**Indentation**: Visual indentation shows the depth and nesting of objects within the hierarchy.

## Use Cases

**System Navigation**: Quickly navigate through complex system hierarchies to find and open specific objects deep within the structure.

**Structure Review**: Understand the complete decomposition of a system, seeing all levels of hierarchy in one view.

## Export Options

Tree views can be exported as images.
