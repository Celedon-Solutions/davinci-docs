The Digital Thread View visualizes requirements and their relationships as an interactive graph, providing a comprehensive view of requirement traceability and interconnections throughout your system model.

## Overview

The Digital Thread View creates a network diagram showing how requirements relate to each other and to other model objects. Each requirement appears as a node, with arrows representing relationships between them. This visualization makes it easy to understand requirement dependencies, trace satisfaction paths, and identify gaps in your requirements structure.

## Graph Elements

### Nodes

Each node in the graph represents a requirement object and displays:

- **Requirement Name**: The identifier for the requirement
- **Satisfaction Status**: Visual indicator showing if the requirement is satisfied (TRUE/FALSE)
- **Parent Path**: Hierarchical location in the model
- **Documentation**: Descriptive text explaining the requirement (when enabled)
- **Constraint Children**: Any constraint objects belonging to the requirement

### Edges

Arrows connecting nodes represent relationships between requirements:

- **Child Relationships**: Parent-child hierarchical connections
- **Uses Relationships**: Dependencies where one requirement references another
- **References**: Links to related requirements or objects
- **Custom Relationships**: Any custom relationship types defined in your project

Each edge is color-coded and labeled according to its relationship type, making it easy to distinguish different connection types at a glance.

## Interactive Features

**Pan and Zoom**: Click and drag to pan around the diagram. Use mouse wheel or pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

**Click Nodes**: Click on any requirement node to navigate to that requirement object for detailed viewing or editing.

**Click Edges**: Click on relationship arrows to view relationship details.

## Layout

The Digital Thread View uses a force-directed layout algorithm that automatically positions nodes to minimize edge crossings and create a clear, readable diagram. The layout:

- Spaces nodes evenly with repulsion forces
- Pulls connected nodes closer together with spring forces
- Optimizes readability by preventing node overlap
- Adapts automatically as you add or remove requirements

## Use Cases

**Requirement Traceability**: Visualize how high-level requirements decompose into lower-level requirements and trace satisfaction through the system hierarchy.

**Dependency Analysis**: Identify which requirements depend on others and understand the impact of changes.

**Gap Identification**: Spot requirements without implementing components or components without requirements by analyzing the graph structure.

**Design Reviews**: Present requirement relationships and traceability to stakeholders in an intuitive visual format.

**Impact Assessment**: Understand which requirements will be affected by changes to specific system elements.

**Verification Planning**: See which requirements are satisfied and which need additional work.

## Building a Digital Thread

The Digital Thread automatically includes:

1. **The focused requirement** (root)
2. **Child requirements** (hierarchical structure)
3. **Related requirements** (via relationships)
4. **Constraint children** of each requirement
5. **Connected objects** that satisfy or impact requirements

As you build relationships between requirements and other objects (parts, constraints, etc.), the digital thread grows to show the complete traceability network.

<Note>
The Digital Thread View is most effective when requirements have well-defined relationships. Use relationships like "satisfies", "derives", and "refines" to build comprehensive traceability.

## Best Practices

**Clear Naming**: Use descriptive requirement names to make the graph easier to understand at a glance.

**Relationship Types**: Use appropriate relationship types to clearly indicate the nature of connections between requirements.

**Hierarchical Structure**: Organize requirements in a clear parent-child hierarchy for better visualization.

**Documentation**: Add documentation to requirements to provide context when viewing nodes in the graph.

**Regular Review**: Use the Digital Thread View during design reviews to verify complete traceability and identify missing connections.

## Export

The Digital Thread diagram can be exported as an image for documentation, presentations, and design reviews.
