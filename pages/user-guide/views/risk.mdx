## Description

The Risk View displays a risk matrix that visualizes Risk objects according to their probability and impact levels. This view provides an at-a-glance understanding of project risks, their severity, and their relative priorities.

The view consists of two main sections: a color-coded risk matrix grid in the upper portion, and a detailed risk table in the lower portion. Risks are positioned in the matrix based on their probability (horizontal axis) and impact (vertical axis), with colors indicating overall risk severity.

## Risk Matrix Grid

The matrix grid displays risks as labeled boxes positioned according to their probability and impact values. The grid background uses color coding to indicate risk severity zones:
- **Green zones**: Low risk (low probability and/or low impact)
- **Yellow zones**: Medium risk
- **Red zones**: High risk (high probability and high impact)

Each risk box shows:
- Risk name or identifier
- Position based on current probability and impact values

Click on any risk box to open that risk object for detailed viewing or editing.

## Risk Table

The lower portion contains a sortable, filterable table showing all risks with detailed information:
- **Name**: Risk identifier
- **Description**: Brief description of the risk
- **Probability**: Likelihood of occurrence
- **Impact**: Severity if the risk occurs
- **Category**: Risk category classification
- **Mitigation**: Planned mitigation strategies
- **Status**: Current risk status

The table allows you to edit risk fields directly and provides a comprehensive view of all project risks.

## View Controls

### Resizable Sections

Drag the horizontal divider between the matrix and table to adjust the relative sizes of each section. This allows you to focus on whichever view is most useful for your current task.

### Category Settings

Risk categories (probability and impact levels) are configured in Project Settings under the Risk tab. Changes to category definitions automatically update the matrix grid layout and coloring.

## Use Cases

**Risk Assessment**: Quickly identify which risks pose the greatest threat to project success based on their position in the matrix.

**Risk Prioritization**: Use the visual representation to prioritize mitigation efforts on high-probability, high-impact risks in the red zones.

## Export Options

Risk matrix and data can be exported for reporting and analysis.
