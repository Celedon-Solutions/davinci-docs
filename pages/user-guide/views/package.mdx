## Description

The Package View displays hierarchical block diagrams of Package objects, showing the structural decomposition and relationships between child objects. This view automatically generates visual representations that help you understand the organization and containment of elements within a package.

Packages serve as organizational containers in system models, grouping related elements together. The Package View renders these relationships as nested blocks, making it easy to visualize system structure at various levels of abstraction.

## View Controls

### Depth

Controls how many levels deep into the package hierarchy the diagram displays. Increase depth to see more nested children, or decrease it to focus on top-level organization.

### Show Documentation

Toggle to display or hide documentation text for each package element. When enabled, documentation appears within or alongside each block in the diagram.

### Refresh

Regenerates the package diagram. Use this if the layout needs updating after model changes or if elements appear misaligned.

### Orientation

Choose between horizontal and vertical layout orientations for the diagram. This affects how child elements are arranged relative to their parent containers.

## Interaction

**Pan and Zoom**: Click and drag to pan around large diagrams. Use mouse wheel or pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

**Click Objects**: Click on any block to open that object in a new workspace tab.

**Home Button**: Returns the view to centered, default zoom level.

## Use Cases

**System Architecture Visualization**: View the decomposition of complex systems into subsystems and components.

**Organizational Structure**: Understand how model elements are grouped and related within packages.

## Export Options

Package diagrams can be exported as images.
