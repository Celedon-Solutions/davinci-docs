## Description

The Block View illustrates relationships between parts and their port interfaces in a block diagram format. This view automatically generates diagrams showing system architecture, component connections, and interface relationships.

Parts are represented as rectangular blocks, with ports shown on block edges. Relationships between parts are visualized as lines connecting the relevant blocks or ports, providing a clear picture of system connectivity.

## View Controls

### Depth

Controls how many levels of hierarchy to include in the block diagram. Shallow depth shows only top-level parts, while deeper settings reveal nested subsystems and components.

### Orientation

Choose between horizontal and vertical layout for the diagram. This affects how blocks are arranged and how connection lines are routed.

### Show Documentation

Toggle to display or hide documentation text for parts and interfaces within the diagram.

### Refresh

Regenerates the block diagram layout. Use this if the diagram needs updating after model changes or if blocks appear misaligned.

## Diagram Elements

**Blocks**: Rectangular boxes representing parts or subsystems. Block size and color may vary based on object type or properties.

**Ports**: Small markers on block edges representing interface points. Port positions indicate connection locations.

**Relationships**: Lines connecting blocks show relationships between parts. Line style may vary based on relationship type (connects, uses, etc.).

**Inferred Relationships**: Relationships that exist at lower-level children are inferred when viewing upper-level objects. These appear as dotted lines in the diagram.

<Note>Only relationships that specifically exist between parts are displayed in this view.</Note>

## Interaction

**Pan and Zoom**: Click and drag to pan around large diagrams. Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

**Click Blocks**: Click on any block to open that part object.

**Click Ports**: Click on ports to view or edit port details.

## Use Cases

**Architecture Visualization**: Understand system architecture by seeing how major subsystems and components connect and relate to each other.

**Interface Analysis**: Identify all interfaces between parts, useful for integration planning and interface control documentation.

## Export Options

Block diagrams can be exported as images.
