## Description

The Activity View displays activity diagrams for Action objects, showing the flow of actions, decisions, and control logic. This view uses a two-pane layout with code editor on the left and generated diagram on the right, allowing you to define activity flows in text and see them visualized instantly.

Activity diagrams illustrate workflows, decision points, parallel actions, and loops using standard activity diagram notation. The view parses your activity definition code and automatically generates the corresponding visual representation.

## View Controls

### Code Editor

The left pane contains a code editor where you define the activity flow using structured syntax. Changes to the code automatically update the diagram on the right after a brief delay.

### Wrap

Toggle line wrapping in the code editor for better readability of long lines.

### Depth

Controls how deep into nested actions and sub-activities the diagram displays.

### Orientation

Choose between horizontal and vertical layout for the activity diagram flow.

### Show Documentation

Toggle to display or hide documentation text for activities and actions within the diagram.

### Show Flows

Control visibility of flow lines between actions.

### Show Performers

Toggle display of performers (actors or systems) responsible for executing actions.

### Refresh

Regenerates the activity diagram from the current code definition.

## Diagram Elements

Activity diagrams include:
- **Actions**: Rectangular blocks representing individual actions or operations
- **Decisions**: Diamond shapes for conditional branching
- **Flow Lines**: Arrows showing the sequence and flow of control
- **Start/End**: Circular markers indicating activity start and end points
- **Parallel Actions**: Synchronized bars for concurrent execution paths

## Interaction

**Pan and Zoom**: In the diagram pane, click and drag to pan. Use mouse wheel to zoom.

**Edit Code**: Modify the activity definition in the left pane to change the diagram structure.

## Use Cases

**Process Documentation**: Model business processes, workflows, and operational procedures.

**Algorithm Visualization**: Illustrate complex algorithms and control flow logic in a visual format.
