Each slice of the pie represents a child resource or resource allocation, with slice size proportional to the resource amount. Colors differentiate between different resources or categories, and labels show resource names and values.

## Chart Elements

**Pie Slices**: Each slice represents a resource allocation. Slice angle is proportional to the resource amount relative to the total.

**Labels**: Resource names and amounts are displayed on or near their corresponding slices.

**Legend**: A legend identifies which color corresponds to which resource or category.

**Total**: The chart typically shows the total resource amount, either in the center or as a caption.

## Resource Types

The Pie Chart View works with various resource types:
- **Budget**: Financial resources allocated across projects or tasks
- **Time**: Time allocations or schedule distributions
- **Mass**: Physical resource distributions in engineering systems
- **Personnel**: Team member allocations across work items
- **Custom Resources**: Any user-defined resource type

## Interaction

**Hover**: Hover over slices to see detailed information about that resource allocation.

**Click Slices**: Click on a slice to open the associated resource object for detailed viewing or editing.

## Use Cases

**Resource Allocation Review**: Quickly see where resources are allocated and identify areas of over or under-utilization.

**Budget Visualization**: Understand budget distributions across projects, phases, or cost categories at a glance.
