The Right Panel can be hidden or shown via the button in the Tab Header.

Each of these tabs offer a unique way to interact with the data in your model. We explore each deeper in its own page below:

## Davinci Agent

The Davinci Agent tab is where instructions to the Agentic Design system are passed. Here, text, images, and model objects can be passed to the Agent to begin work on the model.

## Search Panel

The Search Panel is a more powerful way to search for data within your model. The Search Panel allows for not only search based on object name, similar to the Search bar in the Header, but also allows searches data fields and relationships for usages of model objects, string literals, and more.

## Error Panel

Error Panel is incredibly useful for fixing data issues within a model. It allows users to view all syntax or logical errors within the model, identifying both the root causes of errors, as well as any additional errors caused by that root error. The Error Panel also displays all model objects marked as TBD, allowing you to see where additional work may be needed to complete your model.
