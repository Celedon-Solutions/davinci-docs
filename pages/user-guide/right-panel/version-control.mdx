title: Version Control View
---

The Version Control View provides comprehensive project-wide version control management with support for branching, merging, committing changes, and viewing commit history. Version control in Davinci is multiplayer-enabled, allowing teams to collaborate effectively on the same model with full branch management capabilities.

## Branches

The Branches section allows you to manage all aspects of your project's branch structure. Version control in Davinci operates at the project level, meaning all changes and branches are shared across all collaborators.

### Creating Branches

New branches can be created from the current branch at any time. This allows you to experiment with changes or work on features in isolation without affecting the main branch.

### Switching Branches

You can switch between existing branches using the branch selector. When switching branches, any uncommitted changes will remain live in the previous branch and will be preserved when you return to that branch.

<Note>Uncommitted changes do not transfer between branches when switching. They remain in the branch where they were made.</Note>

### Merging Branches

To merge changes from one branch into another:

1. First, switch to the branch you want to merge **into** (the target branch)
2. Click the **Merge** button
3. Select the branch you want to merge **from** (the source branch)
4. Review the merge preview showing the number and types of changes that will be applied, along with any merge conflicts
5. Complete the merge
6. Resolve merge conflicts

<Warning>Merges cannot be performed when uncommitted changes are present on the current branch. Commit or undo your changes before merging.</Warning>

#### Merge Conflicts

Conflicts occur when the same object or field has been modified in different ways on both branches. Davinci identifies two types of conflicts for model objects:

**Change-Change Conflicts**: The object was modified differently on both branches. You must select which version to keep or manually resolve the differences.

**Change-Delete Conflicts**: The object was changed on one branch and deleted on the other. You must choose whether to keep the changed object or delete it entirely.

    <img noZoom src="/images/merge_conflicts.png" />
</Frame>

All other scenarios are automatically resolved by Davinci's merge logic.

#### Resolving Conflicts

All merge conflicts in the model can be viewed from the [Validation View](/pages/user-guide/right-panel/validation-view) using the Merge Conflict filter

Merge conflicts can be resolved cooperatively by any team member working in that branch. All users will see the same conflicts and can work together to resolve them.

When a conflict is resolved, it appears as a change in the Changes section. Commit the change to finalize the conflict resolution.

<Note>Project-level settings (units, secrets, dependencies, tags, and risk configurations) are also tracked by version control. Conflicts for these objects are managed from the [Project Settings](/pages/user-guide/navigating/project).</Note>

### Deleting Branches

Branches can be deleted when they are no longer needed.

To delete a branch:
1. Select the trashcan icon in the Branch section
2. In the menu, select the branch you would like to delete
3. Select confirm
4. If you are currently in the branch to be deleted, you will be asked again to confirm; Select confirm

You cannot delete the main branch of the project.

## Changes

The Changes section displays all modifications made since the last commit on the current branch. This section shows changes from all users working on the current branch, providing full transparency for collaborative work.

### Viewing Changes

Click on any object in the changes list to open a diff view showing exactly what has changed since the last commit. You can view both the live editable object and the diff view simultaneously for easy comparison.

<Frame>
    <img noZoom src="/images/diff_view.png" />
</Frame>

The diff view highlights:
- **Added content** in green
- **Removed content** in red  
- **Modified fields** with before/after comparisons

### Undoing Changes

Each object in the changes list has an **Undo** button that will revert all changes made to that specific object since the last commit. 

<Warning>Some changes may affect other objects due to relationships and dependencies. Undoing changes to one object may create additional changes in related objects.</Warning>

### Committing Changes

To commit your changes:

1. Review the list of modified objects
2. Enter a descriptive commit message (required)
3. Click the **Commit** button

<Frame>
    <img noZoom src="/images/commit_changes.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>Commits require at least one change since the last commit and a commit message. Commits are manual and only occur when explicitly performed by a user.</Note>

Commits capture the current state of all changes and create a permanent record in the project's history. All team members will be able to see your commits in the commit history.

## Graph

The Graph section displays the complete commit history for the current branch, showing a chronological list of all commits with their associated metadata.

<Frame>
    <img noZoom src="/images/version_control_graph.png" />
</Frame>

### Viewing Commit Details

Each commit in the graph shows:
- Commit message
- Author name
- Commit timestamp

Hover over any commit to see additional information:
- Full commit hash
- Exact date and time
- Change statistics (Insertions, Deletions, Modifications)

<Frame>
    <img noZoom src="/images/commit_hover_details.png" />
</Frame>

### Inspecting Commits

Click on any commit in the graph to open it in a new tab. From this detailed view you can:
- See the complete list of objects modified in that commit
- Click on any object to view the diff showing changes applied by that commit
- Review the full context of what was changed and why

<Frame>
    <img noZoom src="/images/commit_detail_view.png" />
</Frame>

### Rolling Back

You can roll back to any previous commit by clicking the **Rollback** button in the commit detail view. This will:
- Create a new commit on the current branch
- Restore the project to the state it was in at that commit
- Preserve all commits between the rollback point and the current state (you won't lose history)

<Warning>Rolling back will discard any uncommitted changes on the current branch. Make sure to commit or undo any work in progress before performing a rollback.</Warning>

Rolling back does not delete or hide commits—it creates a new commit that reverses the changes made since that point. This maintains a complete audit trail of all project changes.
