The Right Panel Search Panel is a more powerful version of the Search Bar in the Header. Header Search only allows searching by Object Name or Short Name. Right Panel Search takes this a step further, allowing search by Name, Short Name, data fields, documentation, relationships, uses, tags, and more.

## Searching

Search Panel has two optional settings for refining your search:

1. `Case Sensitive`: When enabled, Case Sensitive will only return results that match the casing of the input. For example, a search for "Mass" will not return results with the title "mass".
2. `Exact Match`: When enabled, only results that exactly match the search terms will be returned (not case-sensitive unless enabled above). For exmaple, a search for "Mass" will not returnn results with the title "Total Mass"

Each search result will include a card with the Object Name or Short Name, Path, and Object Type. It will also include a list of data fields that include the Search term(s), highlighting the search terms in each.

Click on a result to open that Object in the Workspace.

Displayed at the top will be a count of how many unique Model Objects are found, along with how many Search term matches are found. 

<Note>The unique Model Objects count will often be lower than Search term matches, as the terms can appear in multiple places in the same Object.</Note>

## Tag Search

Right Panel Search can also be used to show all Model Objects that have a certain Tag. 

Use `#` followed by the Tag name to search for all Objects with that Tag applied. Currently only one Tag can be searched for at a time.
