title: Validation View
---

The Validation View allows users to see where Errors and incomplete objects may exist within the Model in one central location. 

All Model Objects with Value Resolution Errors will appear here. These errors can range from unit mismatches, to logical errors, and more.

Each result shown in the Validation View will be a "Root Cause", meaning the error or TBD originates from that Object. 

Errors and TBDs can propagate through the Model if Objects with Errors or TBDs are used to calculate other Objects. These secondary errors are shown under the `Affected Objects` section in each card as appropriate.

The total number of Objects affected by a Root Cause error or TBD will also be shown in the badge at the top right corner of each error card.

## Fix Error Button

Each error card will contain a `Fix Error` button. 

Clicking this button will pass the Model Object and error message directly to the Agent to be fixed. The Agent will then apply a fix, and the user can either accept or reject the fix. If accepted, the change is applied to the Object and the error should be resolved.

## Send To Agent Button

Each TBD card will contain a `Send to Agent` button. Because TBDs are a little more difficult to resolve, the Agent usually requires more context than the Model alone can provide.

Clicking this button will add text to the [Davinci Agent](/pages/user-guide/right-panel/agent-chat) area directly referencing the TBD Object and asking the Agent to resolve the TBD. Here, users should provide additonal context for how the TBD should be resolved, including specific numbers, units, equation examples, etc. Once all needed context is added, send the message as normal and the Agent will resolve the TBD.

## Errors vs TBDs

It is important to understand the difference and intent behind an Error vs a TBD.

### Errors

A Value Resolution Error is an error that occurs when Davinci attempts to resolve an equation into a final value. These errors can be caused by incorrect or incompatable units, unauthorized characters or inputs in different field types (letters in a "number" field, for example), or other logical errors within the equation.

Each of these will result in an error in the resolution field.

### TBDs

TBDs are a special status given to Attributes, Requirements and Constraints that are either empty, or have "TBD" written in their equation field. TBD Objects are incomplete, and should be filled in once their data or equation is known. This can be useful if, for example, a constraint is identified, but not fully realized in scope yet. 

TBD Objects indicate an incomplete Model, and should be resolved as soon as possible.
