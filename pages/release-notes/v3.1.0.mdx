## Version 3.1.0 - Agent Toolboxes

### New Features

#### Davinci Toolboxes
Toolboxes allow Davinci Agents to execute custom, user defined instructions

- Davinci Agents can now use Toolboxes to assist with tasks
- Toolboxes allow Davinci Agents to execute custom, user defined instructions
- Users can create custom Toolboxes within Davinci
    - Toolboxes are created using Python scripts
    - Toolboxes can be exported as MCP Servers
    - Users can test Toolbox functionality before allowing Agent use
- Agents will automatically choose appropriate Toolboxes when performing tasks
    - Toolboxes can be deactivated to prevent automatic Agent use as desired
- Toolboxes and custom Code Objects can save files to the Project as Reference Objects
- Toolboxes and custom Code Objects can update existing Attribute Object values

#### Index Redesign
The Index has been reworked to add new functionality and a higher level of polish on existing functions

- Rearranging Elements within the Index is now smoother and more consistent
- Redesigned the Drop Indicators when moving Index Elements
    - Known Bug: Drop Indicators for Index Elements sometimes do not adhere to parent/child restrictions and will show invalid drop locations
- Redesigned the Drop Indicators when dragging external Files into the Index
    - Files will now be uploaded to the nearest parent Package object
    - File destinations are now indicated by a light box surrounding the Package that will contain the Reference Object after File upload
    - File uploading now adheres to the parent/child restrictions imposed on Reference Objects
- Index Elements can now be dragged into the Workspace to open new Tabs
    - Known Bug: If multiple Index Elements are dragged into the Workspace at once, only the first Object will be opened


### Improvements
- Better overlay and feedback when dragging Files into Davinci
    - Files can be dropped anywhere on the Workspace or Chat when in the Model Area to upload them directly to the Library
    - Files can be dropped in the Index to upload them directly to a specific Package
- Inactive Files can now all be cleared at once with a new button in the Files Tab
    - Note: Clearing inactive Files may cause compatibility issues with Snapshots that use them
    - [Read more about Inactive Files here](/user-guide/overview/files)
- Stability and Reliability improvements to Snapshots
    - Known Bug: If a Snapshot takes more than 5 seconds to apply, the User may be redirected back to the Home screen until the Snapshot is fully applied. Re-open the Project once the Snapshot is fully applied.
- Improvements to Agent Display
    - Agent Tool Inputs and Responses are now viewed directly in chat instead of a separate window
    - Removed the split view previously used for Agent Responses
    - Added a Checkpoint system to Agent Conversations
    - Added ability for the User to Undo individual Agent Actions

- Removed ability to duplicate Reference Objects

### Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug related to deleting multiple Model Objects at once
- Fixed a bug related to client-side Model Database traversal
- Fixed a bug related to resizing Workspace Panes via double clicking Tab headers
- Fixed a bug that allowed Reference Objects to be children of other Reference Objects
- Several fixes to internal command routing and AI performance
- Several backend fixes for performance and stability
