## Your Subscription

- You can update your payment method or change your Subscription from the Account Screen.
- When subscribing, you will be charged for the first month of the Subscription. The Davinci Subscription will renew each month and the same payment method will be charged.


## Credits
Credits are used for automated operations within Davinci, such as generating new Model Objects with Davinci, asking and answering questions with Davinci, and uploading files to the Project. 

There are two types of Credits:

### Subscription Credits
- Subscription Credits are included with your Davinci Subscription. These Credits are refilled on your billing date, whether monthly or annual, up to the total provided by your plan.

- For example, if your plan provides 20,000 Credits every month, and you used 15,000 Credits last month, you will be  refilled back to 20,000 Credits on your next billing date.

- Subscription Credits are always used first. Because they are included in your plan, we will always use your Subscription Credits before any other source.

- Subscription Credits cannot be purchased separately from a Subscription Plan.

<Note>Subscription Credits do not roll over between billing periods</Note>

### Credit Wallet
The Credit Wallet holds Credits that are purchased from the Credit Shop. The Credit Wallet differs from Subscription Credits in a few key ways:
