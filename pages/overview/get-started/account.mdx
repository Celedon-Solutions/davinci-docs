## Account
- Your account information includes your Name and Email Address.
- A unique license key is provided for your account. Support may need this key to assist you.
- You can manage your account settings, including logging out, from the Account Screen accessed by clicking your user bubble in the top right of Davinci.

<Note>Keep your License Key private. Do not let others access your License Key</Note>

## Your Subscription
- Your current Subscription tier and renewal date are displayed in the Account Screen.
- You can update your payment method or change your Subscription from the Account Screen.
- When subscribing, you will be charged for the first month of the Subscription. The Davinci Subscription will renew each month and the same payment method will be charged.


## Credits
Credits are used for automated operations within Davinci, such as generating new Model Objects with Davinci, asking and answering questions with Davinci, and uploading files to the Project. 

**There are two types of Credits:**

### Subscription Credits
- Subscription Credits are included with your Davinci Subscription. These Credits are refilled on your billing date, whether monthly or annual, up to the total provided by your plan.

- For example, if your plan provides 20,000 Credits every month, and you used 15,000 Credits last month, you will be  refilled back to 20,000 Credits on your next billing date.

- Subscription Credits are always used first. Because they are included in your plan, we will always use your Subscription Credits before any other source.

- Subscription Credits cannot be purchased separately from a Subscription Plan.

<Note>Subscription Credits do not roll over between billing periods</Note>

### Credit Wallet
The Credit Wallet holds Credits that are purchased from the Credit Shop. The Credit Wallet differs from Subscription Credits in a few key ways:

- Credits in the Credit Wallet do not expire.

- The Credit Wallet balance is only used after all other sources of Credits are exhausted.

- Credits can be purchased for the Credit Wallet at any time in the Account Screen.

## Billing
Billing will occur each period on the billing date. This date is listed on the Account Screen in Davinci. It can also be accessed in your [Stripe Customer Portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/eVacOJ0ZDfWvdR65kk)
