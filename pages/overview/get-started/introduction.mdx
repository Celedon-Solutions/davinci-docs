## What is Davinci?  

Davinci is an automated digital engineering tool that transforms natural language inputs into complete models. It serves as your AI design assistant, integrating knowledge storage, data visualization, coding, and documentation into a seamless, end-to-end platform.  

## How Does It Work?  

Davinci is an end-to-end digital engineering platform that unifies model-based systems engineering, knowledge management, documentation, and code development with the power of AI. Davinci brings together your system designs, legacy documents, code, and more into a single source of truth. Our intelligent database seamlessly connects information with AI design agents that can generate solutions, answer questions, and automate data product creation, enabling a smoother, faster, and smarter engineering workflow. Build system models, write proposals, and perform complex analysis all in one unified environment.
