  Object Types:

    Part: Purpose is to represent a primary structural element of a system, whether physical or logical. Parts are the building blocks that have an extent in time and space and can own Attributes to define their parameters and characteristics. They can be decomposed into sub-parts to create a hierarchy.

    Attribute: Purpose is to define the characteristics, parameters, or properties of the objects that own them. An Attribute holds a value, which can be a singular piece of data (like a number or text), a mathematical equation, or a reference to other Attributes in the model. Attributes can also explicitly define units for their values, enabling consistent calculations and conversions.

    Requirement: Purpose is to formally capture the needs, conditions, or constraints that a system must satisfy. Requirements are typically expressed as evaluable "shall" statements and their satisfaction is determined by the logical state (TRUE/FALSE) of their owned sub-requirements or associated Constraint objects. They are crucial for verification and validation.

    Action: Purpose is to describe the behavior, processes, or functions of a system. Actions can be broken down into nested levels of sub-actions to model complex sequences, flows, and transformations. They detail what a system or its parts do, including interactions and state changes. The sequence of actions can define a behavioral flow, including parallel and branching paths.

    Code: Purpose is to represent executable code snippets in python that can be run within the Davinci environment. Code objects allow for custom calculations, analyses, simulations, or interactions with the model data programmatically and update values in the model. They can reference model objects to use their values as inputs and can generate outputs like plots or data files.

    Constraint: Purpose is to define a logical condition or limitation that must be met by the system, expressed as a mathematical or boolean expression. Constraints are evaluated as either TRUE or FALSE and are often used to specify detailed conditions for Requirements or to govern the behavior/values of Attributes.

    Port: Purpose is to define specific interaction points on Parts or other objects where connections can be made. Ports enable the flow of data, energy, or material between different components of a system, acting as interfaces for these interactions.

    Interface: Purpose is to define how and which Ports are linked together within the model, thereby establishing a named connection or pathway. An Interface can link multiple ports, signifying that all included ports share that common connection for interaction or exchange (e.g., a ground plane).

    Document: Purpose is to create structured, human-readable documentation artifacts directly within the modeling environment. Documents can contain various content blocks like rich text sections, headings, lists, and can embed other artifacts like Tables and Images, creating a comprehensive narrative linked to the model.

    Table: Purpose is to present model data in a structured, tabular format (rows and columns). Tables are often used to summarize information about multiple objects, compare parameters, or display specific datasets derived from the model in ways views alone cannot. They can reference object fields dynamically and are synched with the model.

    Reference Object: Purpose is to incorporate existing external information or legacy data into the Davinci model. These are typically uploaded files (like PDFs, text files, JSON, etc.) that serve as a source of truth, context, historical data, or input data for model elements or AI-driven generation tasks.

    Package: Purpose is to organize and group other model objects within the project's hierarchy, much like folders in a file system. Packages help in structuring large models and improving navigability.

    Entity: Purpose is to model actors or elements that are not strictly physical parts but play a role in the system, such as persons, organizations, or groups. Entities are a special kind of Part and can have attributes and perform actions, similar to physical parts.

    Geometry/Assembly: Purpose is to represent the 3D geometry (brep) and physical arrangement. Assemblies would define how parts fit together. (Note: Feature not available in public access).

       Properties: Edit key object fields (Name, Docs, Attributes, Constraints, References, Relationships).
       Code: Code editor (auto-save, '@' refs to embed attributes or reference objects, import local code) & output terminal ('plt.show' renders plots, shows errors, or prints). Run/stop code. AI inline edits. Save Figures.

       Artifact: For Documents (block-based editing, '@' refs to link object data, inline AI edits) & Tables (text/reference cells, direct value editing) & Slides (images, text, tables in slide format).

       Render Views:
        Table View: Presents summary tables of objects, organized by rows based on object type (including descendant paths). Columns for different fields or child objects can be toggled. Indentation shows parent-child relationships. Depth and displayed columns are configurable in the header.

        Tree View: Provides a hierarchical breakdown of an object's descendant tree. For each block, display of its related owned objects or documentation can be toggled.

        Equation Rollup View (for Attributes): Visualizes the roll-up tree of referenced values used in equations that determine an attribute's value.

        Block View: Illustrates relationships between Parts and any Port interfaces in a block diagram format. Lower-level relationships infer connections at upper levels (shown with dotted lines). Only displays relationships specifically between Parts.

        Digital Thread View: Visualizes object relationships in a 3D space, based on connection count and density. Depth relative to the focus object is configurable. Home button re-centers on the focus object.

       Reference View: Displays Reference Object content (text, PDF viewer).

    Index: Left panel. Library (Reference Objects and base area where file uploads get added) & Model. Right-click actions, drag-drop rearrange. Filter object types to show in the index. Lock/Unlock objects.

    Navigation/UI:
      Nav Bar (left): Model, Project, Home areas.
      Home Area: Project lists (Owned, Shared), New Project.
      Project Area: Tabs for Summary (stats, rename, export JSON/SysMLv2), Snapshots, Collaborators, Units, Relationships, Files.
      Header Bar (top): Docs, Version, Nav Arrows, Connection Indicator, Search, Account Management.

    Snapshots: Save/restore model state as snapshots (Manual & Automatic). 'Push To Active' restores a snapshot to the active model (affects all collaborators).

    Collaboration: Real-time multi-user editing. Manage collaborators & roles (Owner, Collaborator, Pending) in Project Area. Users editing code will lock lines they are active in. User editing documents will lock blocks they are active in. Users editing tables will lock cells they are active in.

    File Management:
      Uploading: Files can be uploaded directly through Chat (drag-and-drop or by clicking the paperclip icon) or by using the 'Upload File' button in the Project Area > Files tab. When uploaded, files are created as Reference Objects in the Library section of the Index and are also added to the project's cloud storage.
      Status: Uploaded files can be 'Active' (currently in the project Library, likely connected to model objects or documentation) or 'Inactive' (deleted from the Library by a user, no longer used in the current model version, but retained in project storage to maintain Snapshot integrity).
      Management in Project Area > Files Tab: This tab allows for efficient management of all project files. You can sort files by name, size, type, and other parameters, as well as view file UUIDs. From here, Inactive files can be permanently deleted from project storage. Renaming of files (Reference Objects) is done via the Library Index.
      Warning: Permanently deleting Inactive files from the Files Tab can damage previously created Snapshots that relied on these files, potentially rendering parts of those Snapshots incomplete or unrecoverable. Only delete files if you are certain they are no longer needed for any version of the model.

    Hotkeys: CTRL+C/V (copy/paste text or objects), CTRL+I/B/U (italic/bold/underline), CTRL+Z/Y (undo/redo manual actions).

    Units & Equations:
      Functionality: Attributes and Constraints use values that can be simple (like text or numbers) or complex mathematical equations that link to other objects. Davinci has a broad built-in library of units (for length, mass, time, energy, etc.), supports standard decimal and binary prefixes, and includes many physical constants. Users can also define custom units if needed (via Project Area > Units tab).
      Equation Construction: Equations are written in Attribute values or Constraint expressions using standard mathematical symbols for multiplication (e.g., "A * B"), division (e.g., "A / B"), addition (e.g., "A + B"), exponentiation (e.g., "A ^ B"), and functions like "min(A, B)" and "max(A, B)". Comparison operators (equals, not equals, less than, greater than, etc.) are also used, especially in Constraints.
      Attribute Value Types & Units: The type of an Attribute's value (e.g., Boolean, Date, Number, String) determines how it's handled and whether units apply. 'Number' types can have units; Davinci attempts unit conversions if compatible (e.g., when one attribute references another with a different unit, or in tables with unit-defined headers). 'Boolean', 'Date', and 'String' types generally ignore or clear units.
      Referencing in Equations:
        Unit Referencing: Units can be specified directly with a number (e.g., "10 kg"). If an attribute references another with a compatible but different unit, its value will be transformed if possible. Incompatible units or impossible conversions will result in an error.
        Object Referencing: To use another object's value (typically an Attribute's) in an equation, reference it using the '@' symbol followed by its name or shortname (e.g., "@attributeName * @anotherAttribute"). This pulls in the referenced object's value and its unit for the calculation.
      Special Handling: Text values like "TBD" (To Be Determined) are handled specially to avoid premature errors when a value is not yet finalized during model development.

    Relationships: Define connections between objects (Uses, Reference, Performs, Subject, Connect, Data, Power, Mechanical, etc.).
