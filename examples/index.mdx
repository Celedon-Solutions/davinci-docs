## Why These Examples Matter

These examples demonstrate how Davinci addresses critical challenges in systems engineering:

- **Speed & Efficiency**: Reduce modeling time from hours to minutes
- **Eliminate Manual Transcription**: Extract structured data directly from source documents
- **Maintain Traceability**: Automatic linking between requirements, design, and source artifacts
- **Living Documentation**: Transform static documents into queryable, analyzable models
- **Reduce Technical Debt**: Establish structured foundations early in the program lifecycle

<Tip>
Start with the example that most closely matches your current workflow or challenge. Each example includes step-by-step instructions, sample prompts, and visual walkthroughs.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

Each example follows a similar pattern:

1. **Upload (Optional)**: If you have existing artifacts (diagrams, PDFs, documents), bring them into Davinci to extract structured data
2. **Prompt**: Use natural language to tell Davinci what you want to extract or create
3. **Review**: Examine the generated model elements and their source traceability
4. **Refine**: Iteratively enhance the model with additional detail and relationships
