To verify your key input your license into the text box (A) and then press the validate button (B)

<Note>Once the key is verified, this window will not popup on application restart. To modify the key and access other account settings go to the profile view.</Note>

### Making and Selecting Projects
From the home page users can either make a new project or select an existing one from your database. Once selected the project data is loaded into the client and you can work on your project. As you edit, all changes are synched with the database.

## Main User Interface

### Layout
The user interface has three main regions that allow different kinds of functionality and interactions. 

* **Top Bar**: The top bar holds specific workspace related buttons (top-left), the version number of Davinci including updates (top-center), and the close and resize buttons for the application (top-right).

* **View Tabs**: The side tab holds the different views of the tool, modifying the viewspace layout and allowing different features to be used in Davinci. Each of these are described in detail under the **View Tabs** documentation.


* **Viewspace**: This is the primary region where the user will model or perform other interactions.
