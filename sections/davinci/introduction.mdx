## Getting Started
First time users will need to input their license key to access Davinci. Once the key is verified this window will not popup on restart. To modify the key and access other account settings go to the user account tab.

From the home page users can either make new projects or select existing ones from your database.

<Note>During the Davinci Beta, each key has its own seperate project database which is not shareable. Collaborative editing will be added later.</Note>

### Layout
The user interface has three main regions that allow different kinds of functionality and interactions. 

* **View Tabs**: The side tab holds the different views of the tool, modifying the workspace layout and allowing different features to be used in Davinci. Each of these are described in detail under the **Tabs** documentation.

* **Top Bar**: The top bar holds specific workspace related buttons (top-left), the version number of Davinci including updates (top-center), and the close and resize buttons for the application (top-right).

* **Workspace**: This is the primary region where the user will model or perform other interactions.
