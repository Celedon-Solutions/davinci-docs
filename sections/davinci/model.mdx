## Overview
The System Modeling tab is where the project system model is viewable and interactable.

### User Interface Layout

## Index
The index contains the navigation view of the system model, organized by their child parent relationships. From the index objects can be selected which are populated into the workspace. 

<Tip>Click and drag to move objects around.</Tip>

<Tip>Right-click to access manual features such as creating, renaming, and deleting objects.</Tip>

## Chat
The chat is the primary interaction with Davinci's AI features. Here users can provide prompts to instruct Davinci on what to create, update, or remove from the model. Optionally, the user can select different creation depths using the slider on the top-right of the change bar to guide the AI in providing more or less detail when creating new object trees. 

<Tip>Generally using names in the chat is sufficent, but to be specific the @ can be used to ensure an accurate reference to that specific object.</Tip>


## Workspace
The workspace is where object information can be viewed and manually edited from. 

### Tabs
The top of the workspace contains a tab row which houses tabs or any objects selected from the index. Selecting the tabs changes the focus object and what is displayed in the workspace.

<Tip>Use middle click to quickly close tabs.</Tip>

<Tip>Drag tabs into either side of the main workspace to split the view into subpanes to see objects side-by-side.</Tip>

### Tab Page
Below the tab row is the object path which shows the full parent path up to the top level packages in the model.

<Tip>Click on the object names in the parent path to navigate between them.</Tip>

The main workspace contains the object details which can be displayed in different render types. What views are avaiable for an object depend on its type, but the following views are possible:

* **Tabular**: Displays the details of an object in a table like view.

* **Tree**: Displays the owned objects of the focus object in a tree. 

* **Block**: Displays the port or allocation interfaces of the focus object.

* **Rollup**: Displays the required subattributes as a tree. 

* **Activity**: Displays the activity flow of an action object.
