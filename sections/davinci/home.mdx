## Making New Projects
When mousing over the project area a new project button will appear at the bottom of the project list. When clicking this a new row will appear to allow for the project name to be provided. After providing a project name hit enter and an id will be assigned by the database server to the new project. Once the id is assigned that new project can then be loaded by clicking on it.

<Note>Project must be supplied a valid name (without special characters)</Note>

## Deleting Projects
When hovering over the project in the project list a trash icon will appear on the right side. Selecting this will prompt a confirmation to delete or cancel the action. 

<Warning>Deletion of a project is irreversible</Warning>


## Reloading Projects
In the event that a project needs to be reloaded from the project server, use the sync icon when hovering over the project in the list.
