- Credit usage that changes model state is shown in the [event log](/sections/davinci/model#event-log).
- Credits are also used when answering questions and uploading documents and will update the Credits Remaining value below the chat field.
- The current amount of total available credits is shown in the [chat](/sections/davinci/model#chat) as Credits Remaining.
