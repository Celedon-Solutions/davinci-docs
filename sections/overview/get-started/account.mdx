## Credits
Credits are used for automated operations within Davinci. There are two types of credits:
- **Subscription Credits**: Credits included with your monthly subscription
- **Credit Wallet**: Additional purchased credits
- Your total credits are the sum of both subscription credits and credit wallet credits.
- When using computation credits, subscription credits will always be used first before any purchased credits.
- Credits are used whenever you run a task via the Davinci.
- Credits are also used when answering questions and uploading documents.

- Each project's size contributes to your total storage usage.
