Davinci Beta is an innovative system modeling application designed to streamline the process of engineering. Utilizing state-of-the-art natural language processing, Davinci allows users to generate, modify, and interact with models using simple, intuitive commands. Below are the key features of the Davinci Beta.

## Key Features

### Modeling Capabilities

Davinci supports a wide range of modeling objects and capabilities, including:

- **Parts**: Primary structural elements of the model.
- **Attributes**: Properties associated with model objects.
- **Connections**: Links between parts to define relationships.
- **Requirements**: Capture and manage system requirements.
- **Constraints**: Logical statements that can be evaluated.
- **Packages**: Organize and manage collections of model elements.
- **Ports**: Define interconnection points for parts.
- **Actions**: Describe the behavior of the system.
- **Entities**: Represent people, organizations, or groups.

### Artifact Creation

Davinci enables the creation of various artifacts directly within the modeling environment, such as:

- **Documents**: Hyperlinked plain language documents with integrated tables and figures (.docx).
- **Tables**: Smart tables with dynamic population of cells (.xlsx).
- **Figures**: Display model objects as different diagram types (.png).

### Automation Abilities

Davinci offers robust automation features to enhance modeling efficiency:

- **Natural Language Interface**: Automate object creation and modifications using natural language prompts.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Update and link between objects dynamically.
- **Question and Answer**: Retrieve information from the model using natural language queries.
- **Artifact Generation**: Create text, tables, and figures from model data automatically.

### Application Abilities

Additional capabilities of the Davinci application include:

- **Auto-Generation**: Generate tree, block, and activity diagrams automatically.
- **Data Export**: Export data in various formats (.docx, .xlsx, .png).
- **Units Library**: Standard units library with automatic conversions.
- **Constraint Evaluation**: Perform logical and constraint evaluations.
- **Manual Editing**: Create and edit model objects manually.

### Best Practices

- **Be Direct and Provide Context**: Clear instructions and context improve Davinci's performance.
- **Focus on Specific Tasks**: Keeping tasks focused enhances the quality of the output.
- **Use Keywords**: Specify the types of objects you want to create.
- **Review Outputs**: Regularly review and correct the model to maintain accuracy.

## Data Security

Davinci uses state-of-the-art models for its design engine and stores project data securely. However, during the beta, avoid storing sensitive information such as ITAR/EAR, CUI, or confidential data.
