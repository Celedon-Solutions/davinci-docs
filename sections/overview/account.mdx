## Account
- Upon subscribing to Davinci, an email with an account link will be sent to your inbox.
- This link will take you to your subscription page where you can view and manage your subscription.
- The subscription page link is also available within Davinci in the profile view under the 'Computation Credits' section.

## Subscription Billing
- When subscribing, you will be charged for the first month of the subscription. The Davinci Beta subscription will renew each month and the same payment method will be charged.
- Upon successful payment, your subscription credit balance will be refilled to 5000 credits.

## Purchasing Additional Credits
- Additional computation credits may be purchased in the profile view under 'Load Credits'
- The options for additional credit purchases are:
    - 5,000 credits for $25
    - 12,000 credits for $50
    - 25,000 credits for $100
- When purchasing additional credits, a different payment method from the subscription may be used. This will not affect your subscription payment method.
- After purchasing credits, click on the refresh button to refresh the available credits for your account.

## Using credits
- Credits are used whenever you run a task via the Davinci [chat](/sections/davinci/model#chat).
- Credit usage that changes model state is shown in the [event log](/sections/davinci/model#event-log).
- Credits are also used when answering questions
- The current amount of total available credits is shown in the [event log](/sections/davinci/model#event-log) as credits remaining.
- When using computation credits, subscription credits will always be used first before purchased credits.
