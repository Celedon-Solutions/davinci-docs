# Objects

All data objects in Davinci have the following base properties that can be edited or defined.

## Base Fields

| Property        | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`          | The name of the object.                                                                          |
| `Shortname`     | An acronym, ID, or other short name for the object. This is used when displaying the object as a reference in equations or other anchor elements in code. |
| `Documentation` | The written summary, intent, or description of the object.                                        |

## Reference Objects

For non-reference objects, an additional field exists to link to a reference object:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reference` | Links to reference objects that inform or are the source of the value, structure, or property of the object. |

## Interface Objects

For interface objects, a field is added to indicate which objects are connected as part of the named interface:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Connects`  | Lists all the objects that are part of the named interface.                                     |

## Attribute Objects

For attribute objects, a field is added to show the value, equation, and unit associated with the attribute:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Value`     | The value or equation of the attribute, including its unit and kind.                             |

<Note>Artifacts, actions, and code objects all have unique view editors to define their specific parameters and are not discussed here.</Note>

## Object Descriptions

Below is a list of common objects in Davinci, along with their descriptions:

|  | Name       | Description                                                                                     |
| -- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Part](images/objections/part.svg) | `Part`      | Represents a physical or logical component in the model. It can have associated attributes and constraints. |
| ![Action](images/objections/action.svg) | `Action`    | Defines operations or behaviors that occur within the system, such as triggering events or changing states. |
| ![Code](images/objections/code.svg) | `Code`      | Represents executable code snippets or functions within the system, often used for dynamic behavior or processing. |
| ![Constraint](images/objections/constraint.svg) | `Constraint` | Defines a condition or limitation on the system, often expressed as a boolean expression or mathematical relation. |
| ![Attribute](images/objections/attribute.svg) | `Attribute` | Represents characteristics of an object, including values, equations, units, and kinds. |
| ![Port](images/objections/port.svg) | `Port`      | Used to connect components or objects, typically representing an input or output point for data or signals. |
| ![Interface](images/objections/interface.svg) | `Interface` | Defines a set of connections or interactions between objects, allowing them to communicate or share information. |
| ![Document](images/objections/document.svg) | `Document`  | Represents a structured document or record within the system, typically containing sections, tables, and references. |
| ![Table](images/objections/table.svg) | `Table`     | A structured representation of data in rows and columns, typically used to organize attributes, values, or objects. |
| ![Reference](images/objections/reference.svg) | `Reference` | A pointer to another object or resource within the system, often used to link related data or establish dependencies. |
| ![Package](images/objections/package.svg) | `Package`   | Represents a collection of related objects or modules, typically used for organizing and managing a set of components or resources. |
