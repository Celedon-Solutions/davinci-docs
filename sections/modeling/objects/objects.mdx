## Base Fields

All data objects in Davinci have the following base properties that can be edited or defined.

| Property        | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`          | The name of the object.                                                                          |
| `Shortname`     | An acronym, ID, or other short name for the object. This is used when displaying the object as a reference in equations or other anchor elements in code. |
| `Documentation` | The written summary, intent, or description of the object.                                        |

In addition to the base fields objects also have a `lock` status which will prevent editing of the object until it is unlocked. 

<Note>Locking (or unlocking) will automatically lock all of children elements and their descendents. This action can be undone by unlocking those child elements.</Note>


### Reference Objects

For non-reference objects, an additional field exists to link to a reference object:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reference` | Links to reference objects that inform or are the source of the value, structure, or property of the object. |

### Interface Objects

For interface objects, a field is added to indicate which objects are connected as part of the named interface:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Connects`  | Lists all the objects that are part of the named interface.                                     |

### Attribute Objects

For attribute objects, a field is added to show the value, equation, and unit associated with the attribute:

| Property    | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Value`     | The value or equation of the attribute, including its unit and kind.                             |

<Note>Artifacts, actions, and code objects all have unique view editors to define their specific parameters and are not discussed here.</Note>

## Object Descriptions

Below is a list of objects in Davinci, along with their descriptions:

|  Name       | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Part`      | Represents a physical or logical component in the model. It can have associated attributes and constraints. |
| `Requirement`      | Represents a requirement for the project. Requirements are true or false based on the state of their owned requirements and/or owned constraints being true or false. |
| `Action`    | Defines operations or behaviors that occur within the system, such as triggering events or changing states. |
| `Code`      | Represents executable code snippets. |
| `Constraint` | Defines a condition or limitation on the system, expressed as a boolean expression with a mathematical relation. |
| `Attribute` | Represents characteristics of an object, including values which are equations with unit and kind. |
| `Port`      | Used to connect components or objects, typically representing an input or output point for data or signals. |
| `Interface` | Defines a set of connections or interactions between objects via ports. |
| `Document`  | Represents a structured document artifact containing sections and tables in a pageful display. |
| `Table`     | A structured artifact representation of data in rows and columns, used to organize object data. |
| `Reference` | A provided legacy data object used to build the model from, such as a pdf, json, etc.  |
| `Package`   | Organize objects together in a folder structure. |
