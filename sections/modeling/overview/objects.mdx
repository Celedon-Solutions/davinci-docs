## Language
Davinci uses the System Modeling Language (SysML) v2 as the base modeling schema to represent concepts with its digital model. This schema is wrapped within a database method that allows graphical interactions with easy search and traversal. At the heart of this schema are "objects" which are specific things used to represent the concepts of the system being modeled.

In addition to the core SysML, several extentions exist for custom document-based artifact creation built from the digital model.


## Supported Objects
