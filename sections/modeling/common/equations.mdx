## Descriptions
Each attribute and constraint object has a defined value. For attributes, this includes the unit, the type of value, and any associated equations. For constraints, the value is simply a boolean statement. These values can either be simple values, like strings or numbers, or complex mathematical relations involving values from other objects.

<Note>Special handling is applied when resolving values containing strings of `TBD` (To Be Determined). This can be useful during the early stages of model formation to note resolve errors when the value is still being defined.</Note>

## Math Syntax
Standard mathematical operations can be used within attribute values to compute derived values or perform other simple calculations. The syntax for these operations follows standard mathematical conventions:

| Operation        | Syntax   |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Multiplication   | `A * B`  |
| Division         | `A / B`  |
| Addition         | `A + B`  |
| Exponentiation   | `A ^ B`  |
| Minimum          | `min(A, B)` |
| Maximum          | `max(A, B)` |

| Comparison Operators | Syntax   |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| Equal                | `==`     |
| Unequal             | `!=`     |
| Smaller             | `<`      |
| Larger              | `>`      |
| Smaller or Equal    | `<=`     |
| Larger or Equal     | `>=`     |

## Value Types
Attributes can have the following kind assoicated to a value, which handles how it is displayed or computed:

| Type      | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Boolean` | Represents `true` or `false` values. Does not use a unit and clears any existing unit. |
| `Date`    | Used for date values. Does not use a unit and clears any existing unit. |
| `Number`  | Represents standard numeric values. Optionally includes a unit. |
| `String`  | Represents string values. Does not use a unit and clears any existing unit. |

## Unit Referencing
Values can reference units inline, such as `10 kg`, where the number is associated with the unit.

## Object Referencing
To reference other objects within an equation, use the `@` symbol followed by the object’s name. This will automatically resolve the object’s value and unit.
