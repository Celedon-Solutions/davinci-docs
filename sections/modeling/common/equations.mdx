## Descriptions
All attribute and constraint objects have a defined value. For attributes these specify the unit, the kind of its value, and any equation assoicated. For constraints this is just a boolean statement. For each they are an equation which can be simple values, such as a strings or numbers, or full mathmatical relationa between valuea or other objects.

<Note>Special handling is given when resolving values that have TBD in them, this can be used during early model formation.</Note>

## Math Syntax
Standard mathmatical operations can be used in values of attributes to build roll up values or other simple math operations. The syntax for this follows the standard format:

| Operation | Synatx |
| -------- | ----- | 
| Multiplication   | `A*B` |
| Division | `A/B` |
| Addition | `A + B` |
| Powers | `A^B` |
| Minimum | `min(A, B)` |
| Maximum | `max(A, B)` |

| Operators | Synatx |
| -------- | ----- | 
| Equal  | `==` |
| Unequal | `!=` |
| Smaller | `<` |
| Larger | `>` |
| Smaller or Equal | `<=` |
| Larger or Equal | `>=` |

## Value Kinds
The following kinds are allowed in attribute values
| Kind | Usage |
| -------- | ----- | 
| `Boolean`  | True/False values. Does not use any unit field and clears any existing unit |
| `Date` | Used to format the date result. Does not use any unit field and clears any existing unit |
| `Number` | Used for standard numbers. Allows the use of a unit to be assigned to it (optional) |
| `String` | Used for strings. Does not use any unit field and clears any existing unit |



## Unit Referencing
Values can be defined inline with other attribute references as `10 kg`.

## Object Referencing
Use the `@` command to find and select objects to use in the equation. These objects will automatically use their resolved value and defined unit.
