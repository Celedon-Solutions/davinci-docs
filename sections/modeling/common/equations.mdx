## Syntax
Standard mathmatical operations can be used in values of attributes to build roll up values or other simple math operations. The syntax for this follows the standard format:

| Operation | Synatx |
| -------- | ----- | 
| Multiplication   | `A*B` |
| Division | `A/B` |
| Addition | `A + B` |
| Powers | `A^B` |
| Minimum | `min(A, B)` |
| Maximum | `max(A, B)` |

| Operators | Synatx |
| -------- | ----- | 
| Equal  | `==` |
| Unequal | `!=` |
| Smaller | `<` |
| Larger | `>` |
| Smaller or Equal | `<=` |
| Larger or Equal | `>=` |

## Unit Referencing
Values can be defined inline with other attribute references as `10 kg`.

## Object Referencing
Use the `@` command to find and select objects to use in the equation. These objects will automatically use their resolved value and defined unit.
