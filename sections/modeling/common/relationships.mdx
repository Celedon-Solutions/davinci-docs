title: Relationships

## Description
Objects in the model have defined relationships with each other that establish an explicit knowledge graph of the system being modeled. These relationships are either unidirectional (`inout`) or bidirectional (`in` or `out`) and can be traversed by the user while exploring the model. A summary of the existing relationships in Davinci are dicussed below: 


### Base Relationships
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Uses`  | Specifies the attribute referenced into equations of other attributes. Can be `in` and `out`. |
| `Reference`   | Used for between reference object and any other object type. Is `out` from the reference object and `in` to its target. |


### SysML Standard Relationships
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Performs`     | Specifies what object performs the intent of an action.  Is `out` from the part and `in` to the action                 |
| `Subject`      | Specifies the object that realizes a requirement.  Is `out` from the requirement and `in` to the target object                          |
| `Connect`   | Used for interface relationships between ports as defined by interface objects. Is `inout`.|



### Part Specific Relationships
<Note>All of the following are defined as `inout`.</Note>

| Property        | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Data`            | Refers to the object that carries or provides the necessary information to perform an action.     |
| `Power`           | Denotes the object that supplies energy or force to enable or achieve a desired effect or action. |
| `Mechanical`      | Relates to physical systems and processes that involve motion, force, or mechanical interaction.   |
| `Optical`        | Describes actions or interactions related to light, vision, or the properties of optical systems.  |
| `Chemical`        | Refers to the relationships and interactions involving chemical substances or processes.          |
| `Electromagnetic` | Defines the interactions or connections involving electromagnetic forces, such as electricity or magnetism. |
| `Thermal`         | Pertains to heat-related interactions or processes, such as temperature changes or thermal energy transfer. |
