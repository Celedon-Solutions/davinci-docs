## Description
Objects in the model have defined relationships with each other that establish an explicit knowledge graph of the system being modeled. These relationships are bi-directional and can be traversed by the user while exploring the model. A summary of the relationships include: 


### Base Relationships
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Uses  | Specifies the attribute referenced into equations of other attributes. Can be in and out. |
| Reference   | Used for between reference object and any other object type. Is out from the reference object and in to its target. |


### SysML Relationships
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Performs     | Specifies what object performs the intent of an action.                   |
| Subject      | Specifies the object that realizes a requirement.                        |
| Connect   | Used for interface relationships between ports as defined by interface objects. |



### Base Relationships
All of the following are defined as inout.
