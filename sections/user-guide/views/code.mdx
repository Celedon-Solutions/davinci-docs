title: Code View
---

## Description  
The Code View allows users to edit specific fields and structures of code objects beyond their base properties. This view consists of two panes: the left pane contains the code editor, while the right pane serves as the output terminal.  

<img height="400" noZoom src="/images/workspace_example_code.jpg" />  

<Note>Use `plt` to generate plots in the terminal.</Note>  

## Code Editor  
The code editor enables you to modify code, and all changes are automatically saved as you edit.  

You can reference values from model objects within the code using `@` or other script-based methods. When attributes are referenced, only the resolved values are passed into the compiled code.  

To import other local code, use the standard import notation followed by `@` to specify the reference anchor:  

```.py
    import [reference anchor here...]
``` 

<Note>During live collaboration, only one user can edit a given line of code at a time.</Note>

To execute a code object, click the Run button in the top-right corner of the header bar. At any time you can halt execution by hitting the Stop button.

<Note>During live collaboration only one user can edit a given line of code at one time.</Note>

To run any code objects simply press the run button on the top right of the header bar.

### Output Terminal
The output will display any print or plots. If errors occur they will also be displayed here.


<Info>By default, the output window is closed. It automatically opens when code is executed and can be toggled using the `Output` button on the right side of the header bar.</Info>

<Note>The output terminal does not retain data. It resets when the workspace tab is closed or when the same code is rerun.</Note>
