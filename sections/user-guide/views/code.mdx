title: Code View

## Description
The code view allows the user to edit the specific fields and structure of code objects (beyond the base properties). This view has two panes, the left being the code editor and the right being an output terminal.

<Note>You must use `plt` to plot data into the terminal.</Note>

### Code Editor
The code editor allows you to edit the code. When editing the code is automatically saved.

You can reference values from model objects into the code using `@` or other scripts. For attributes referenced, only the resolved value is passed into the compiled code. 

To import other local code, use the standard import notation followed by using `@` to place the reference anchor 

```.py
    import [reference anchor here...]
``` 

When importing other local code objects, all of those functions will be available globally during execute.

<Note>During live collaboration only one user can edit a given line of code at one time.</Note>

To run any code objects simply press the run button on the top right of the header bar.

### Output Terminal
The output will display any print or plots. If errors occur they will also be displayed here.


<Info>By default the output window is closed. When running code it will be automatically opened and can be toggled by clicking the `Output` button on the right side of the header bar.</Info>

<Note>The output will not save data and is reset when the tab is closed, or when the same code is rerun.</Note>
