title: Artifact View
---

## Description
The artifact view allows the user to edit the specific fields and structure of artifact objects (beyond the base properties). This view will dynamically respond to the type of artifact object (`table` or `document`) as well as any selections in that document, such as when selecting a table cell within a document.


### Document Editing
Documents are structured using blocks which can be given different display types, such as a bulleted list, heading, or simple paragraph. 

When viewing a document type object or interacting with text blocks (in either tables or documents) the top panel will show editing features aimed for text operations and block inserts. 

Inside parargraph blocks references can be added using `@` which will place the reference inline. 

<Note>When inserting references the default is name field. To edit this right click the reference to change its display. Only `name` and `value`. For `value` display the unit (if it exists) will always be shown.</Note>

<Warning>If the document has any formatting artifacts, try rebuilding it by clicking on the artifact view again. This will also update any inline references as well.</Warning>

### Table Editing
Table cells can be either text or a reference to an object. Text cells can have paragraphs or lists (bulleted or numbered) and include all the same text editing features as a document block. 

For reference cells, the object and its field to display can be selected. The only fields allowed are `name`, `documentation` and `value`. These values can be directly edited from the top pane for reference cells, which updates the data in that object.

<Info>Tables inside of documents will always default to max page width.</Info>
