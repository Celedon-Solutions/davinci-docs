### Name Header
The name header is the first row of the properties view and allows the renaming of the object and to specify its lock status. 

To change the lock status click on the lock icon. 

The `name` field is updated by the input field next to the object type icon. Following the `name` input field is the `shortname` field. The short name will be used in anchor elements and attribute equations throughout the display if used.

<Note>When locking or unlocking an object its descendents will also be locked/ unlocked.</Note>
