How to get started with a new project in Davinci.

## Login
Access davinci at `LINK HERE` and either create or login with your account.

## Create a Project
From the home page click on the green new project button.

<img height="400" noZoom src="/images/home_start_click.jpg" /> 

 This will focus you into naming a new project inside your existing projects list. 
 
<img height="200" src="/images/viewcaptures/home/home_project_def.jpg" /> 

 Once named, the project will get a uuid. Once that uuid is ready you can click on that element to load in the project. 



## Execute your First Task
From here you can begin any kind of modeling task. Go to the chat window at the bottom and try asking Davinci to build a simple parts tree. Once submitted the task will be started.

## Review the Result 
On task compelete you will see new objects populated in the mode index pane (on the right side of the window). You can either interact directly clicking on objects in the index or you can click on the `View` button in the chat response to see a change log of the AI modifications. 

Happy modeling!
