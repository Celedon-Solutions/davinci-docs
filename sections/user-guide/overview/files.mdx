title: Files & File Storage
---

## Description
Uploading Files is one of the best ways of importing legacy model documentation into Davinci. Old system descriptions, requirements tables, personnel trackers, and other documentation can be uploaded directly into Davinci and easily transitioned into Davinci Model Objects.

Files can be uploaded in one of two ways:

1. Directly through `Chat`
2. Using the File Uploader in the `Project View`>`Files` Tab

<Note>When uploading `Files` to Davinci they are created as both index objects in the model and uploaded to the project storage. Files that are removed from the model are retained in project storage to maintain `Snapshot` integrity.</Note>

Uploaded Files can be referenced directly in chat by referencing them using the "@" menu. Davinci will attempt to utilize information in the `File` when performing the task. 

`Files` can have one of two different statuses:

| Status | Description                   |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `Active` | | Active Files are currently in the project Library. These files are likely, but not necessarily, connected to model objects, documentation, or other parts of the model. These files are actively being used by the model.
| `Inactive` | | Inactive Files are not currently used in the model. They have been deleted from the `Library` by a user and are no longer used or referenced in the current version of the model.


Files can be managed efficiently inside of the `Files` Tab within the `Project View`. Files can be sorted by name, size, type, and other parameters. File UUIDs are also visible here for debugging purposes. 

Files can also be managed from within the `Project View`, in the `Library` section of the `Index`. Files will become Inactive if removed from the `Library`. Files can be permanantely deleted from the `Files Tab`. Files can be renamed in the `Library`.

<Warning>Deleting Inactive Files may damage previously generated model `Snapshots`, and render the files unrecoverable and parts of the model that relied on these files incomplete. Only fully delete files if you are sure they are no longer needed. Files permanantely deleted from the Files Tab are not recoverable.</Warning>
