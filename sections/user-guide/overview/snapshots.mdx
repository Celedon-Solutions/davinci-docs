## Description
Snapshots are used to save the current state of the Model at a point in time. Think of them like a save file in a video game. They can be used to restore the Model to a previous state, or archive past states for future reference.

<Note>Davinci continuously saves your Project as you work. Snapshots are intended as a model archival solution.</Note>

To push a Snapshot to the active Workspace, select one from the lists and click `Push To Active`. We recommend creating a Manual Snapshot before pushing any Snapshot.

Pushing a Snapshot to Active will restore the active Workspace state to the state saved in that Snapshot. All Snapshots, including the one that was just Activated, are retained and can continue to be used at any time.

<Warning>Pushing a Snapshot will revert the active Workspace state for all Collaborators as well.</Warning>

**There are two kinds of Snapshots:**

1. `Manual Snapshots`: Manual Snapshots are Snapshots created directly by Users. They can be created at any time by clicking the `Create Snapshot` button. Give the Snapshot a `Name` (required) and a `Description` (optional) to save the Snapshot. We recommend creating Manual Snapshots at key project milestones, or before experimenting with or making large changes to your model.

2. `Automatic Snapshots`: Automatic Snapshots are Snapshots created automatically by the system periodically. Davinci will automatically create snapshots for projects every 24 hours. An Automatic Snapshot will also be created if none exist, and if it has been longer than 24 hours since the last Automatic Snapshot. These are like regular snapshots but automatically captured. 

<Info>Automatic Snapshots will only be created when the Project is open.</Info>
