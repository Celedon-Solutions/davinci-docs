## Home
The Home page is the first view when loading into Davinci. Here you can select or create projects. The cloud icon on the top indicates connection status with the server. The top right is your user icon, clicking this will load your account page. 

<Note>Before selecting a project, only the home tab is viewable on the far left pane.</Note>

The project list is divided into two tabs, one of your owned projects and the other any projects that you are a collaborator with.

<Note>To add collaborators or rename a project, it must be loaded first and then select the project tab.</Note>

## Model
Once a project is loaded you can access the model tab which is the main workspace where you can create, view, and edit the model.

### Index
The index holds the list of all objects in the project. The two index tabs can be expanded or contracted to navigate the index.

To add objects, rename, copy, and other functions right click the index for an action popout menu.
