## Home
The Home page is the first view when loading into Davinci. Here you can select or create projects. The cloud icon on the top indicates connection status with the server. The top right is your user icon, clicking this will load your account page. 

<Note>Before selecting a project, only the home tab is viewable on the far right pane.</Note>

The project list is divided into two tabs, one of your owned projects and the other any projects that you are a collaborator with.

<Note>To add collaborators or rename a project, it must be loaded first and then select the project tab.</Note>
