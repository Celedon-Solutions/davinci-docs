title: Collaboration

## Description
Projects in Davinci can be shared with other users of Davinci. From the collaborators section in the project tab users can be invited and/or removed from the project. Click the green invite button to add new collaborators to the project. To remove collaborators hover over them in the list and click the delete icon.

The invited user will receive an email inviting them to the project. Once they accept the invitation via the link in the email, they will be added to the project.

<Warning>Compute costs for tasks are defaulted to the user initiating that task. For team level costing, an enterprise account is required.</Warning>

<Info>Only registered users of Davinci can join a project.</Info>

## Roles

Davinci currently supports two kinds of roles, Owner and Collaborator. The owner is the user who initiated the project originally, and the ability to add and remove Collaborators. Collaborators are able to interact with the model, create, edit, and remove elements and objects, and chat with Davinci. Collaborators are not able to invite other Davinci users, remove other Collaborators, or remove the Owner from the project.

Projects are not transferrable to other users at this time, though this is a feature we would like to implement in the future.

<Note>Roles currently only show owner and collaborators. This will be expanded in future releases.</Note>
