## Index
The index holds the list of all objects in the project. The two index tabs can be expanded or contracted to navigate the index.

To add objects, rename, copy, and other similar functions simply right click the index for an action popout menu. To move objects simply click and drag around the index.

<Info>The `LIBRARY` index tab is used to organize project reference information.</Info>

<Note>Some object types can not be children of other types, which will prevent drop or movement.</Note>

<Note>If objects are locked they can not be moved or edited.</Note>

<Note>Dragging files into the window can be dropped into `package` objects in the workspace.</Note>




## Workspace
The workspace is the area to view and edit objects directly. Clicking on objects in the index will open them as tabs inside the workspace.

The workspace can be split into panes by dragging the object workspace tab to the left or right of the workspace area.

<Note>Only a single object can be opened in the workspace at a time.</Note>


Each open object in the workspace will have its focus indicated by the purple highlight. Inside the selected workspace tab is a side panel which allows you to select the view types. Each view will show the object (and its content) in different ways or provide editing options. 

In the bottom of the side panel is the download button which allows you to export the render or data of the view. 

<Note>Exports are an early feature and still have limitations.</Note>




## Chat
The Chat region is where you can interact with the Davinci design agent. Simply type into the Chat box any instructions and the design agent will build a plan and execute that as a series of tasks. 

To clear the Chat history use the delete button (trash icon). Files can also be selected by clicking on the upload icon (paperclip).

<Note>Highlighted names with icons next to them can be double clicked to open in the workspace.</Note>
