title: Navigating Work Areas
---

Basic Navigation in Davinci uses the Navigation Bar to move between Work Areas.

## Navigation Bar
The `Navigation Bar` appears on the far left of the window and has three primary Work Areas:

1. `Model`: Create, view, and edit the Model from here.
2. `Project`: Manage elements of the Project such as Collaborators, Files, and Model Completeness.
3. `Home`: Click here to return to the Home Page.




## Home
`Home` is the first Area viewed when loading into Davinci. Here you can select or create projects.

<Note>Before selecting a project, only `Home` is viewable in the Navigation Bar.</Note>

The project list is divided into two tabs. The first tab is `Owned` which holds all of your Owned projects. The second tab is `Shared` which contains all projects that you are a Collaborator on.




## Model
The `Model` Area appears when a Project is loaded from the Home Area.

## Search
At the top of the window is a search box, clicking on this will open up a search menu. Clicking on search results will open them up in the main tab. 

<Note>You can always ask Davinci in the Chat to find objects for you.</Note>



## Project 
`Project` is accessed from the Navigation Pane on the far left of the window. Like `Model`, this is only active when a project has been selected. In this view you can see the project summary, see collaborators, review snapshots, update custom units, or remove files stored in your project. 

<Note>The project name can only be edited from the project summary.</Note>




## Account Management
Your User Account can be managed at any time by clicking on your initial in the top right of the screen. This will open the `Account Manager`, where you can access information about your subscription, reset your password, or refill your Credits.
