## Description
Requirement objects are used to formally capture a project through logical evaluable statements. These objects are evaluated as true or false based on their owned objects being either true or false. For a requirement to be complete it must either own subrequirement(s) or a constraint object. 

<Note>Object is incomplete is no constraint or subrequirements exist, or all subrequirements are incomplete.</Note>

<Info>Requirement descriotions are modeled as shall statements by Davinci, but only the constraint objects are considered during evaluation.</Info>
