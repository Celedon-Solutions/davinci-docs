## Description
Requirement objects are used to formally capture a project through logical evaluable statements. These objects are evaluated as true or false based on their owned objects being either true or false. For a requirement to be complete it must either own subrequirement(s) or a constraint object. 

<Info>Requirement descriptions are modeled as shall statements by Davinci, but only the constraint objects are considered during evaluation.</Info>

Requirements can have the following status:

| Status | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `TRUE`     | All owned constraints or subrequirement(s) are `TRUE`|
| `FALSE`      | One or all of the owned constraints or subrequirement(s) are `FALSE` |
| `INCOMPLETE`   | Unable to evaluate to either true or false |

<Note>Object is incomplete if no constraint or subrequirement(s) exist or all subrequirement(s) are also incomplete.</Note>
