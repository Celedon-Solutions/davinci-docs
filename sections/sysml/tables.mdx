## Description
Tables display object details in a condensed form. They work using a focus object per row which is defined on the first column of the table. All other columns reference either a field of an object or specifics of its owned objects (such as attributes, ports, conntections, etc.). 

<Note>The first column of the table defines the reference object and can not be renamed.</Note>

The header of tables define what information should be displayed. Changing the name of the header will auto update the column. If needed, each cell reference can be manually edited.

<Note>Units will be displayed in cells (for values with units), units defined in the header as
`[unit]` will auto convert units in the table column</Note>

<Info>This is edited from the document view only</Info>
