## Model Relationships

Objects in the model have defined relationships with each other that establish an explicit knowledge graph of the system being modeled. These relationships are bi-directional and can be traversed by the user while exploring the model. A summary of the relationships include: 

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Performs     | Specifies what object performs the intent of an action.                   |
| Subject      |Specifies the object that realizes a requirement.                        |
| Value   | Specifies the attribute referenced into equations of other attributes. |
| Sequence   | Specifies the action that is part of a sequence in another action. |
| Parent/Child   | Specifies the objects owned relationship and structure in the model. |
| Allocation   | Indication of some connection between the object that occurs at a lower level. |
